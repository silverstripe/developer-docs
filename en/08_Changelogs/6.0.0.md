## Features and enhancements

### Run `CanonicalURLMiddleware` in all environments by default {#url-middleware}

In Silverstripe CMS 5 [`CanonicalURLMiddleware`](api:SilverStripe\Control\Middleware\CanonicalURLMiddleware) only runs in production by default. This lead to issues with `fetch` and APIs behaving differently in production environments to development. Silverstripe 6.0 changes this default to run the rules in `dev`, `test`, and `live` by default.

To opt out of this change include the following in your `_config.php`

```php
use SilverStripe\Control\Middleware\CanonicalURLMiddleware;
use SilverStripe\Core\CoreKernel;

CanonicalURLMiddleware::singleton()->setEnabledEnvs([
    CoreKernel::LIVE,
]);
```

### Other new features

- Native indexed PHP arrays can now be passed into templates and iterated over with `<% loop $MyArray %>`. Under the hood they are wrapped in [`ArrayList`](api:SilverStripe\View\ViewableData), so you can get the count using `$Count` and use `<% if $ArrayList %>` as a shortcut for `<% if $ArrayList.Count %>`. Other functionality from `ArrayList` such as filtering and sorting cannot be used on arrays since they don't have keys to filter or sort against.

## Bug fixes

This release includes a number of bug fixes to improve a broad range of areas. Check the change logs for full details of these fixes split by module. Thank you to the community members that helped contribute these fixes as part of the release!

## API changes

### Most extension hook methods are now protected {#hooks-protected}

Core implementations of most extension hooks such as `updateCMSFields()` now have protected visibility. Formally they had public visibility which meant they could be called directly which was not how they were intended to be used. Extension hook implementations are still able to be declared public in project code, though it is recommended that all extension hook methods are declared protected in project code to follow best practice.

### General changes {#api-general}

- [`DataObject::write()`](api:SilverStripe\ORM\DataObject::write()) has a new boolean `$skipValidation` parameter. This can be useful for scenarios where you want to automatically create a new record with no data initially without restricting how developers can set up their validation rules.
- [`FieldList`](api:SilverStripe\Forms\FieldList) is now strongly typed. Methods that previously allowed any iterable variables to be passed, namely [`FieldList::addFieldsToTab()`](api:SilverStripe\Forms\FieldList::addFieldsToTab()) and [`FieldList::removeFieldsFromTab()`](api:SilverStripe\Forms\FieldList::removeFieldsFromTab()), now require an array to be passed instead.
- [`BaseElement::getDescription()`](api:DNADesign\Elemental\Models\BaseElement::getDescription()) has been removed. If you had implemented this method in your custom elemental blocks, either set the [`description`](api:DNADesign\Elemental\Models\BaseElement->description) configuration property or override the [`getTypeNice()`](api:DNADesign\Elemental\Models\BaseElement::getTypeNice()) method.
