## Features and enhancements

### Changes to `sake`, `BuildTask`, and CLI interaction in general {#cli-changes}

Until now, running `sake` on the command line has executed a simulated HTTP request to your Silverstripe CMS project, using the routing and controllers that your web application uses to handle HTTP requests. This resulted in both a non-standard CLI experience and added confusion about when an [`HTTPRequest`](api:SilverStripe\Control\HTTPRequest) actually represented an HTTP request.

We've rebuilt Sake using [`symfony/console`](https://symfony.com/doc/current/console.html) - the same package that powers Composer.

Here are some common commands you can run with Sake:

```bash
# list available commands
sake # or `sake list`

# list available tasks
sake tasks

# build the database
sake db:build

# flush the cache
sake flush # or use the `--flush` flag with any other command

# get help info about a command (including tasks)
sake <command> --help # e.g. `sake db:build --help`
```

> [!NOTE]
> To reduce upgrade pains we've retained backwards compatability with the legacy syntax for `dev/*` routed actions (e.g. `sake dev/build flush=1` will still work). This allows you to continue using existing scripts and cron jobs.
> This legacy syntax is deprecated, and will stop working in a future major release.

If for some reason you specifically need to access an HTTP route in your project using Sake, you can use the new `sake navigate` command, e.g. `sake navigate about-us/teams`.

See [sake](/developer_guides/cli/sake) for more information about using and configuring `sake`, including how to register your own custom commands.

There is also a new [`PolyCommand`](api:SilverStripe\PolyExecution\PolyCommand) class which provides a standardised API for code that needs to be accessible from both an HTTP request and CLI. This is used for `BuildTask` and other code accessed via `/dev/*` as mentioned below.

See [`PolyCommand`](/developer_guides/cli/polycommand) for more details about the `PolyCommand` API.

#### Changes to `BuildTask` {#cli-buildtask}

##### Change to API {#cli-buildtask-api}

The [`BuildTask`](api:SilverStripe\Dev\BuildTask) class is now a subclass of `PolyCommand`.

As a result of this, any `BuildTask` implementations in your project or module will need to be updated. The upgrade will likely look like this in most cases:

```diff
 namespace App\Tasks;

-use SilverStripe\Control\Director;
-use SilverStripe\Control\HTTPRequest;
 use SilverStripe\Dev\BuildTask;
+use SilverStripe\PolyExecution\PolyOutput;
+use Symfony\Component\Console\Command\Command;
+use Symfony\Component\Console\Input\InputInterface;
+use Symfony\Component\Console\Input\InputOption;

 class MyCustomTask extends BuildTask;
 {
-    private static $segment = 'my-custom-task';
+    protected static string $commandName = 'my-custom-task';

-    protected $title = 'My custom task';
+    protected string $title = 'My custom task';

-    protected $description = 'A task that does something custom';
+    protected static string $description = 'A task that does something custom';

-    public function run(HTTPRequest $request)
+    protected function execute(InputInterface $input, PolyOutput $output): int
     {
+        if ($input->getOption('do-action')) {
-        if ($request->getVar('do-action')) {
-            if (Director::is_cli()) {
-                echo "Doing something...\n"
-            } else {
-                echo "Doing something...<br>\n";
-            }
+            $output->writeln('Doing something...');
         }
-        echo "Done\n";
+        return Command::SUCCESS;
     }
+
+    public function getOptions(): array
+    {
+        return [
+            new InputOption('do-action', null, InputOption::VALUE_NONE, 'do something specific'),
+        ];
+    }
 }
```

Note that you should no longer output "done" or some equivalent message at the end of the task. Any time a task finishes executing, the output will include a message about whether the task completed successfully or failed (based on the return value) and how long it took.

See [`PolyCommand`](/developer_guides/cli/polycommand#buildtask) for more details about the `BuildTask` API.

##### Change to names {#cli-buildtask-names}

Some tasks were relying on the FQCN instead of having an explicit name. This means the name used for both the URL and the CLI command were excessively long.

The way these are displayed in the new `sake tasks` list doesn't suit long names, so we have given explicit names to these tasks in order to make them shorter. If you have scripts or cron jobs that reference these you will need to update them to use the new name.

For example, you used to navigate to `/dev/tasks/<OLD_NAME>` or use `sake dev/tasks/<OLD_NAME>`. Now you will need to navigate to `/dev/tasks/<NEW_NAME>` or use `sake tasks:<NEW_NAME>`.

|class|old name|new name|
|---|---|---|
|[`ContentReviewEmails`](api:SilverStripe\ContentReview\Tasks\ContentReviewEmails)|`SilverStripe-ContentReview-Tasks-ContentReviewEmails`|`content-review-emails`|
|[`DeleteAllJobsTask`](api:Symbiote\QueuedJobs\Tasks\DeleteAllJobsTask)|`Symbiote-QueuedJobs-Tasks-DeleteAllJobsTask`|`delete-queued-jobs`|
|[`MigrateContentToElement`](api:DNADesign\Elemental\Tasks\MigrateContentToElement)|`DNADesign-Elemental-Tasks-MigrateContentToElement`|`elemental-migrate-content`|
|[`UserFormsColumnCleanTask`](api:SilverStripe\UserForms\Task\UserFormsColumnCleanTask)|`SilverStripe-UserForms-Task-UserFormsColumnCleanTask`|`userforms-column-clean`|
|[`StaticCacheFullBuildTask`](api:SilverStripe\StaticPublishQueue\Task\StaticCacheFullBuildTask)|`SilverStripe-StaticPublishQueue-Task-StaticCacheFullBuildTask`|`static-cache-full-build`|

#### Changes to `/dev/*` actions {#cli-dev}

With the changes to `sake` come changes to the way `dev/*` actions are handled. Most of these are now subclasses of the new [`DevCommand`](api:SilverStripe\Dev\Command\DevCommand) class which is itself a subclass of `PolyCommand`.

One small change as a result of this is the `dont_populate` parameter for `dev/build` and for the new `db:build` CLI command has been deprecated. Use `no-populate` instead. For example use `https://example.com/dev/build/?no-populate=1` and `sake db:build --no-populate`.

##### Registering `dev/*` commands {#cli-dev-registering}

If you have custom actions registered under `DevelopmentAdmin.registered_controllers` you'll need to update the YAML configuration for these. If you want them to be accessible via CLI, you'll also have to update the PHP code.

With the below example, there are two custom actions displayed in the list at `/dev`:

- `/dev/my-http-only-action`: intended for use in the browser only, but you'd have to add custom logic in `init()` to disallow its use in CLI until now
- `/dev/my-http-and-cli-action`: intended for use both in CLI and in the browser.

For actions that should only be accessible in the browser, you only need to change how these are registered. Move them from `DevelopmentAdmin.registered_controllers` to the new [`DevelopmentAdmin.controllers`](api:SilverStripe\Dev\DevelopmentAdmin->controllers) configuration property.

Controllers added to `DevelopmentAdmin.controllers` can only be accessed via HTTP requests, so you can remove any logic around CLI usage.

For actions that should be accessible in the browser *and* via CLI, you will need to change these from being a `Controller` to subclassing `DevCommand`. These get registered to the new [`DevelopmentAdmin.commands`](api:SilverStripe\Dev\DevelopmentAdmin->commands) configuration property

```diff

-            || Permission::check('MY_CUSTOM_PERMISSION')
-        );
-    }

     // ...
 }
```

You would now access the `/dev/my-http-only-action` action via an HTTP request only. The `/dev/my-http-and-cli-action` action can be access via an HTTP request, or by using `sake app:my-http-and-cli-action` on the command line.

The `some-var` option can be used in a query string when running the action via an HTTP request, or as a flag (e.g. `sake app:my-http-and-cli-action --some-var`) in CLI.

See [`PolyCommand`](/developer_guides/cli/polycommand#dev-commands) for more details about the `DevCommand` API.

#### `sake -start` and `sake -stop` have been removed {#cli-daemon}

Sake used to have functionality to make daemon processes for your application. This functionality was managed with `sake -start my-process` and `sake -stop my-process`.

We've removed this functionality. Please use an appropriate daemon tool such as `systemctl` to manage these instead.

### Read-only replica database support {#db-read-only-replicas}

Read-only replicas are additional databases that are used to offload read queries from the primary database, which can improve performance by reducing the load on the primary database.

Read-only replicas are configured by adding environment variables that match the primary environment variable and suffixing `_REPLICA_<replica-number>` to the variable name, where `<replica_number>` is the replica number padding by a zero if it's less than 10, for example `SS_DATABASE_SERVER` becomes `SS_DATABASE_SERVER_REPLICA_01` for the first replica, or `SS_DATABASE_SERVER_REPLICA_12` for the 12th replica. Replias must be numbered sequentially starting from `01`.

Replicas cannot define different configuration values for `SS_DATABASE_CLASS`, `SS_DATABASE_NAME`, or `SS_DATABASE_CHOOSE_NAME`. They are restricted to prevent strange issues that could arise from having inconsistent database configurations across replicas.

If one or more read-only replicas have been configured, then for each request one of the read-only replicas will be randomly selected from the pool of available replicas to handle queries for the rest of the request cycle, unless criteria has been met to use the primary database instead, for example a write operation.

See [read-only database replicas](/developer_guides/performance/read_only_database_replicas/) for more details.

When replicas are configured, calling the method [`DB::get_conn()`](api:SilverStripe\ORM\DB::get_conn()) will now give a replica by default if one is able to be used. To get the primary database connection, call `DB::get_conn(DB::CONN_PRIMARY)` instead.

Note that the `DB::CONN_PRIMARY` constant, which has a value of "primary", is used to specify the primary database used. Prior to CMS 6 when there was no DB replica support, the primary database was referred to as "default". If you have code that uses the string "default" to refer to the primary database, you should update it to use the `DB::CONN_PRIMARY` constant instead.

Note that some [`DataQuery`](api:SilverStripe\ORM\DataQuery) methods such as [`DataQuery::execute()`](api:SilverStripe\ORM\DataQuery::execute()) now work slightly differently as they will use the replica database if the queried `DataObject` has the [`DataObject.must_use_primary_db`](api:SilverStripe\ORM\DataObject->must_use_primary_db) configuration set to `true`. However calling the equivalent [`SQLSelect`](api:SilverStripe\ORM\Queries\SQLSelect) method via a `DataQuery` e.g. `$dataQuery->query()->execute()` will not respect the `DataObject.must_use_primary_db` configuration.

### Run `CanonicalURLMiddleware` in all environments by default {#url-middleware}

In Silverstripe CMS 5 [`CanonicalURLMiddleware`](api:SilverStripe\Control\Middleware\CanonicalURLMiddleware) only runs in production by default. This lead to issues with `fetch` and APIs behaving differently in production environments to development. Silverstripe 6.0 changes this default to run the rules in `dev`, `test`, and `live` by default.

To opt out of this change include the following in your `_config.php`

```php
use SilverStripe\Control\Middleware\CanonicalURLMiddleware;
use SilverStripe\Core\CoreKernel;

CanonicalURLMiddleware::singleton()->setEnabledEnvs([
    CoreKernel::LIVE,
]);
```

### Changes to default cache adapters {#caching}

The [`DefaultCacheFactory`](api:SilverStripe\Core\Cache\DefaultCacheFactory) used to use APCu cache by default for your webserver - but we found this cache isn't actually shared with CLI. This means flushing cache from the CLI didn't actually flush the cache your webserver was using.

What's more, the `PHPFilesAdapter` used as a fallback wasn't enabled for CLI, which resulted in having a different filesystem cache for CLI than is used for the webserver.

We've made the following changes to resolve this problem:

- The `PHPFilesAdapter` will only be used if it's available for both the webserver *and* CLI. Otherwise, `FilesystemAdapter` will be used for both.
- There is no default in-memory cache used by `DefaultCacheFactory`.
- Cache factories have been implemented for Redis, Memcached, and APCu, with a new [`InMemoryCacheFactory`](api:SilverStripe\Core\Cache\InMemoryCacheFactory) interface available for your own implementations.

We strongly encourage you to configure an appropriate in-memory cache for your use-case. See [adding an in-memory cache adapter](/developer_guides/performance/caching/#adapters) for details.

### Changes to scaffolded form fields {#scaffolded-fields}

Some of the form fields have changed when scaffolding form fields for relations.

Previously, `File`, `Image`, and `Folder` were all scaffolded using `UploadField` for `has_one` relations, and `GridField` for `has_many` and `many_many` relations.

All other models used `SearchableDropdownField` for `has_one` relations and `GridField` for `has_many` and `many_many` relations.

|Class|`has_one`|`has_many`|`many_many`|
|---|---|---|---|
|[`SiteTree`](api:SilverStripe\CMS\Model\SiteTree)|[`TreeDropdownField`](api:SilverStripe\Forms\TreeDropdownField)|[`TreeMultiselectField`](api:SilverStripe\Forms\TreeMultiselectField)|[`TreeMultiselectField`](api:SilverStripe\Forms\TreeMultiselectField)|

### `SiteTree` uses form field scaffolding {#sitetree-scaffolding}

[`SiteTree::getCMSFields()`](api:SilverStripe\CMS\Model\SiteTree::getCMSFields()) used to create its form fields from scratch, without calling `parent::getCMSFields()`. This meant that all subclasses of `SiteTree` (i.e. all of your `Page` classes) had to explicitly define all form fields.

`SiteTree::getCMSFields()` now uses the same form field scaffolding that all other `DataObject` subclasses use.

Note that this means when you initially upgrade to Silverstripe CMS 6 you may have form fields being added to your CMS edit forms that you don't want to include, or tabs from relations that you don't want. You can use the [`scaffold_cms_fields_settings`](api:SilverStripe\ORM\DataObject->scaffold_cms_fields_settings) configuration property to change which fields are being scaffolded.

For example, if you have a database column for which you don't want content authors to see or edit the value, you can use the `ignoreFields` option to stop the form field for that column from being scaffolded:

```php
namespace App\PageTypes;

use Page;

class MyCustomPage extends Page
{
    // ...
    private static array $db = [
        'SecretToken' => 'Varchar',
    ];

    private static array $scaffold_cms_fields_settings = [
        'ignoreFields' => [
            'SecretToken',
        ],
    ];
}
```

See the [scaffolding](/developer_guides/model/scaffolding/#scaffolding-options) section for more details about using these options.

As part of your CMS 6 upgrade, you should check all of the page types in your project and in any modules you maintain to ensure the correct form fields are available in the appropriate tabs. You should also check [`Extension`](api:SilverStripe\Core\Extension) subclasses that you know get applied to pages to ensure fields aren't being scaffolded from those that you want to keep hidden.

#### What if I don't have time to upgrade all of my page types?

If you have a lot of complex page types and extensions, upgrading all of them to account for the new scaffolding might be a large task. If you want to avoid upgrading your `getCMSFields()` and `updateCMSFields()` implementations initially, you can use the `restrictRelations` and `restrictFields` scaffolding options in the `scaffold_cms_fields_settings` configuration property for your pages. You can then declare that only the fields introduced in parent classes should be scaffolded.

The below YAML configuration can be used as a base for this workaround. It will work for all page types available in commercially supported modules. If you use page types provided in third-party modules, you may need to add configuration for those as well.

> [!WARNING]
> Note that this is explicitly intended as a temporary workaround, so that you can focus on other areas of the upgrade first, and come back to your page form fields later.
>
> As more community modules are upgraded to account for form field scaffolding in their page types and extension classes, you may
> need to add more fields to this list. To avoid having to continuously update these lists it's recommended that you take the time
> to update your `getCMSFields()` and `updateCMSFields()` implementations as soon as you have time to do so.

### Changes to the templating/view layer {#view-layer}

Note that the `SilverStripe\View\ViewableData` class has been renamed to [`SilverStripe\Model\ModelData`](api:SilverStripe\Model\ModelData). We will refer to it as `ModelData` in the rest of these change logs.

See [many renamed classes](#renamed-classes) for more information about this change.

#### Strong typing for `ModelData` and `DBField`

Many of the properties and methods in `ModelData`, [`DBField`](api:SilverStripe\ORM\FieldType\DBField), and their immediate subclasses have been given strong typehints. Previously, these only had typehints in the PHPDoc which meant that any arbitrary values could be assigned or returned.

Most of the strong types are either identical to the old PHPDoc types, or match what was already actually being assigned to, passed into, and returned from those APIs.

In some cases, where a string was expected but sometimes `null` was being used, we have explicitly strongly typed the API to `string`. This matches [similar changes PHP made in PHP 8.1](https://php.watch/versions/8.1/internal-func-non-nullable-null-deprecation) and will help avoid passing `null` values in to functions that expect a string.

The one change we specifically want to call out is for [`ModelData::obj()`](api:SilverStripe\Model\ModelData::obj()). This method will now explicitly return `null` if there is no field, property, method, etc to represent the field you're trying to get an object for. This is a change from the old behaviour, where an empty `DBField` instance would be returned even though there's no way for any non-null value to be available for that field.

See the [full list of removed and changed API](#api-removed-and-changed) to see all of the API with updated typing.

### Changes to `LeftAndMain` and its subclasses {#leftandmain-refactor}

[`LeftAndMain`](api:SilverStripe\Admin\LeftAndMain) has historically been the superclass for all controllers routed in `/admin/*` (i.e. all controllers used in the CMS). That class includes a lot of boilerplate functionality for setting up a menu, edit form, etc which a lot of controllers don't need.

A new [`AdminController`](api:SilverStripe\Admin\AdminController) has been created which provides the `/admin/*` routing functionality and permission checks that `LeftAndMain` used to be responsible for. If you have a controller which needs to be routed through `/admin/*` with the relevant CMS permission checks, but which does *not* need a menu item on the left or an edit form, you should update that class to be a subclass of `AdminController` instead.

As a result of this change, to following classes are now direct subclasses of `AdminController`:

- [`SudoModeController`](api:SilverStripe\Admin\SudoModeController) - used to be a subclass of `LeftAndMain`.
- [`CMSExternalLinksController`](api:SilverStripe\ExternalLinks\Controllers\CMSExternalLinksController) - used to be a direct subclass of [`Controller`](api:SilverStripe\Control\Controller).

### Changes to password validation {#password-validation}

#### `PasswordValidator` changes

The deprecated `SilverStripe\Security\PasswordValidator` class has been renamed to [`RulesPasswordValidator`](api:SilverStripe\Security\Validation\RulesPasswordValidator) and is now optional.

The default password validator is now [`EntropyPasswordValidator`](api:SilverStripe\Security\Validation\EntropyPasswordValidator) which is powered by the [`PasswordStrength` constraint](https://symfony.com/doc/current/reference/constraints/PasswordStrength.html) in `symfony/validator`. This constraint determines if a password is strong enough based on its entropy, rather than on arbitrary rules about what characters it contains.

You can change the required strength of valid passwords by setting the [`EntropyPasswordValidator.password_strength`](api:SilverStripe\Security\Validation\EntropyPasswordValidator->password_strength) configuration property to one of the valid [minScore values](https://symfony.com/doc/current/reference/constraints/PasswordStrength.html#minscore):

```yml
SilverStripe\Security\Validation\EntropyPasswordValidator:
  password_strength: 4
```

`EntropyPasswordValidator` also has the same options for avoiding repeat uses of the same password that `RulesPasswordValidator` has.

This does not retroactively affect existing passwords, but will affect any new passwords (e.g. new members or changing the password of an existing member).

If you want to revert to the validator that was used in CMS 5, you can do so with this YAML configuration:

```yml
---
After: '#corepasswords'
---
SilverStripe\Core\Injector\Injector:
  SilverStripe\Security\Validation\PasswordValidator:
    class: 'SilverStripe\Security\Validation\RulesPasswordValidator'
```

See [passwords](/developer_guides/security/secure_coding/#passwords) for more information about password validation.

#### `ConfirmedPasswordField` changes

If [ConfirmedPasswordField->requireStrongPassword](api:SilverStripe\Forms\ConfirmedPasswordField->requireStrongPassword) is set to true, the old behaviour was to validate that at least one digit and one alphanumeric character was included. This meant that you could have a password like "a1" and it would be considered "strong".

This has been changed to use the [`PasswordStrength` constraint](https://symfony.com/doc/current/reference/constraints/PasswordStrength.html) in `symfony/validator` instead. Now a password is considered "strong" based on its level of entropy.

You can change the level of entropy required by passing one of the valid [minScore values](https://symfony.com/doc/current/reference/constraints/PasswordStrength.html#minscore) into [`ConfirmedPasswordField::setMinPasswordStrength()`](api:SilverStripe\Forms\ConfirmedPasswordField::setMinPasswordStrength()).

### Other new features

- Native indexed PHP arrays can now be passed into templates and iterated over with `<% loop $MyArray %>`. Under the hood they are wrapped in [`ArrayList`](api:SilverStripe\Model\List\ArrayList), so you can get the count using `$Count` and use `<% if $ArrayList %>` as a shortcut for `<% if $ArrayList.Count %>`. Other functionality from `ArrayList` such as filtering and sorting cannot be used on arrays since they don't have keys to filter or sort against.
- Modules no longer need to have a root level `_config.php` or `_config` directory to be recognised as a Silverstripe CMS module. They will now be recognised as a module if they have a `composer.json` file with a `type` of `silverstripe-vendormodule` or `silverstripe-theme`.
- A new [`DataObject::getCMSEditLink()`](api:SilverStripe\ORM\DataObject::getCMSEditLink()) method has been added, which returns `null` by default. This provides more consistency for that method which has previously been inconsistently applied to various subclasses of `DataObject`. See [managing records](/developer_guides/model/managing_records/#getting-an-edit-link) for more details about providing sane values for this method in your own subclasses.
- The `CMSEditLink()` method on many `DataObject` subclasses has been renamed to `getCMSEditLink()`.
- The [`UrlField`](api:SilverStripe\Forms\UrlField) class has some new API for setting which protocols are allowed for valid URLs.
- The [`EmailField`](api:SilverStripe\Forms\EmailField) class now uses `symfony/validator` to handle its validation logic, where previously this was validated with a custom regex.

## Dependency changes

### `intervention/image` has been upgraded from v2 to v3 {#intervention-image}

We've upgraded from `intervention/image` v2 to v3. One of the main improvements included in this upgrade is full support for animated GIFs.

If you are directly interacting with APIs from `intervention/image` in your project or module you should check out [their upgrade guide](https://image.intervention.io/v3/introduction/upgrade).

#### Animated vs still images {#intervention-image-animations}

Manipulating animated images takes longer, and results in a larger filesize.

Because of this, the [`ThumbnailGenerator`](api:SilverStripe\AssetAdmin\Model\ThumbnailGenerator) will provide still images as thumbnails for animated gifs by default. You can change that for a given instance of `ThumbnailGenerator` by passing `true` to the [`setAllowsAnimation()`](api:SilverStripe\AssetAdmin\Model\ThumbnailGenerator::setAllowsAnimation()) method. For example, to allow animated thumbnails for `UploadField`:

```yml
---
After: '#assetadminthumbnails'
---
SilverStripe\Core\Injector\Injector:
  SilverStripe\AssetAdmin\Model\ThumbnailGenerator.assetadmin:
    properties:
      AllowsAnimation: true
```

The [`Image::PreviewLink()`](api:SilverStripe\Assets\Image::PreviewLink()) method also doesn't allow an animated result by default. This is used in the "Files" admin section, and anywhere you can choose an existing image such as `UploadField` and the WYSIWYG file modals.

You can allow animated previews by setting [`Image.allow_animated_preview`](api:SilverStripe\Assets\Image->allow_animated_preview) configuration property to `true`:

```yml
SilverStripe\Assets\Image:
  allow_animated_preview: true
```

You can disable the ability to create animated variants globally by setting `decodeAnimation` to `false` in the `Intervention\Image\ImageManager`'s constructor:

```yml
SilverStripe\Core\Injector\Injector:
  Intervention\Image\ImageManager:
    constructor:
      decodeAnimation: false
```

You can also toggle that configuration setting on and off for a given image instance, or create a variant from your image which uses a specific frame of animation - see [animated images](/developer_guides/files/images/#animated-images) for details.

#### Using GD or Imagick {#intervention-image-driver}

One of the changes that comes as a result of this upgrade is a change in how you configure which manipulation driver (GD or Imagick) to use.

To facilitate upgrades and to ensure we are providing optimal defaults out of the box, if you have the [imagick PHP extension](https://www.php.net/manual/en/book.imagick.php) installed, it will be used as the driver for `intervention/image` by default. If you don't, the assumption is that you have the [GD PHP extension](https://www.php.net/manual/en/book.image.php) installed, and it will be used instead.

See [changing the manipulation driver](/developer_guides/files/images/#intervention-image-driver) for the new configuration for swapping the driver used by `intervention/image`.

#### New API {#intervention-image-new-api}

The following new methods have been added to facilitate this upgrade:

|Method name|Where the method was added|
|---|---|
|`getIsAnimated()`|[`AssetContainer::getIsAnimated()`](api:SilverStripe\Assets\Storage\AssetContainer::getIsAnimated()), [`ImageManipulation::getIsAnimated()`](api:SilverStripe\Assets\ImageManipulation::getIsAnimated()) (and therefore `DBFile`, `File`, and their subclasses), [`Image_Backend::getIsAnimated()`](api:SilverStripe\Assets\Image_Backend::getIsAnimated()), [`InterventionBackend::getIsAnimated()`](api:SilverStripe\Assets\InterventionBackend::getIsAnimated())|
|`RemoveAnimation()`|[`ImageManipulation::RemoveAnimation()`](api:SilverStripe\Assets\ImageManipulation::RemoveAnimation()) (and therefore `DBFile`, `File`, and their subclasses), [`Image_Backend::removeAnimation()`](api:SilverStripe\Assets\Image_Backend::removeAnimation()), [`InterventionBackend::removeAnimation()`](api:SilverStripe\Assets\InterventionBackend::removeAnimation())|
|`getAllowsAnimationInManipulations()`|[`Image_Backend::getAllowsAnimationInManipulations()`](api:SilverStripe\Assets\Image_Backend::getAllowsAnimationInManipulations()), [`InterventionBackend::getAllowsAnimationInManipulations()`](api:SilverStripe\Assets\InterventionBackend::getAllowsAnimationInManipulations())|
|`setAllowsAnimationInManipulations()`|[`Image_Backend::setAllowsAnimationInManipulations()`](api:SilverStripe\Assets\Image_Backend::setAllowsAnimationInManipulations()), [`InterventionBackend::setAllowsAnimationInManipulations()`](api:SilverStripe\Assets\InterventionBackend::setAllowsAnimationInManipulations())|
|`getAllowsAnimation()`|[`ThumbnailGenerator::getAllowsAnimation()`](api:SilverStripe\AssetAdmin\Model\ThumbnailGenerator::getAllowsAnimation())|
|`setAllowsAnimation()`|[`ThumbnailGenerator::setAllowsAnimation()`](api:SilverStripe\AssetAdmin\Model\ThumbnailGenerator::setAllowsAnimation())|

### Symfony dependencies have been upgraded from v6 to v7 {#symfony}

We've upgraded the various Symfony dependencies from v6 to v7.

## Bug fixes

This release includes a number of bug fixes to improve a broad range of areas. Check the change logs for full details of these fixes split by module. Thank you to the community members that helped contribute these fixes as part of the release!

## API changes

### Many renamed classes {#renamed-classes}

There are a lot of classes which were in the `SilverStripe\ORM` namespace and a few in the `SilverStripe\View` namespace that simply don't belong there.

We've moved many of these into more suitable namespaces, and in a few cases have taken the opportunity to rename the class to something more appropriate. You will need to update any references to the old Fully Qualified Class Names to use the new names and namespaces instead.

Note that the change from `ViewableData` to `ModelData` specifically was made to improve the separation between the model layer and the view layer. It didn't make much sense for a class called `ViewableData` to be the superclass for all of our model types. The new name better reflects the purpose of this class as the base class for models.

|Old FQCN|New FQCN|
|---|---|
|`SilverStripe\ORM\ArrayLib`|[`SilverStripe\Core\ArrayLib`](api:SilverStripe\Core\ArrayLib)|
|`SilverStripe\ORM\ArrayList`|[`SilverStripe\Model\List\ArrayList`](api:SilverStripe\Model\List\ArrayList)|

### GraphQL removed from the CMS {#graphql-removed}

> [!INFO] If you need to use GraphQL in your project for public-facing frontend schemas, you can still install and use the [`silverstripe/graphql`](https://github.com/silverstripe/silverstripe-graphql) module.

GraphQL has been removed from the admin section of the CMS and is no longer installed when creating a new project using [`silverstripe/installer`](https://github.com/silverstripe/silverstripe-installer), or an existing project that uses [`silverstripe/recipe-cms`](https://github.com/silverstripe/recipe-cms). All existing functionality in the CMS that previously relied on GraphQL has been migrated to use regular Silverstripe CMS controllers instead.

Any customisations made to the `admin` GraphQL schema will no longer work. There are extension hooks available on the new controller endpoints for read operations, for example [`AssetAdminOpen::apiRead()`](api:SilverStripe\AssetAdmin\Controller\AssetAdminOpen::apiRead()) that allow you to customise the JSON data returned.

PHP code such as resolvers that were in [`silverstripe/asset-admin`](http://github.com/silverstripe/silverstripe-admin), [`silverstripe/cms`](https://github.com/silverstripe/silverstripe-cms) and [`silverstripe/versioned`](https://github.com/silverstripe/silverstripe-versioned) have been move to the [`silverstripe/graphql`](https://github.com/silverstripe/silverstripe-graphql) module and have had their namespace updated. The GraphQL yml config for the versioned module has also been copied over as that was previously enabled by default on all schemas. The GraphQL YAML configuration for the `silverstripe/asset-admin` and `silverstripe/cms` modules has not been moved as as that was only enabled on the admin schema.

If your project does not have any custom GraphQL, after upgrading you may still have the old `.graphql-generated` and `public/_graphql` folders in your project. You can safely remove these folders.

### Most extension hook methods are now protected {#hooks-protected}

Core implementations of most extension hooks such as `updateCMSFields()` now have protected visibility. Formerly they had public visibility which meant they could be called directly which was not how they were intended to be used. Extension hook implementations are still able to be declared public in project code, though it is recommended that all extension hook methods are declared protected in project code to follow best practice.

### Changes to some extension hook names {#hooks-renamed}

In order to better align the codebase in Silverstripe CMS with best practices, the following extension hook methods have changed name:

|class that defined the hook|old name|new name|
|---|---|---|
|[`Member`](api:SilverStripe\Security\Member)|`afterMemberLoggedIn`|`onAfterMemberLoggedIn`|
|[`Member`](api:SilverStripe\Security\Member)|`afterMemberLoggedOut`|`onAfterMemberLoggedOut`|
|[`Member`](api:SilverStripe\Security\Member)|`authenticationFailed`|`onAuthenticationFailed`|
|[`Member`](api:SilverStripe\Security\Member)|`authenticationFailedUnknownUser`|`onAuthenticationFailedUnknownUser`|
|[`Member`](api:SilverStripe\Security\Member)|`authenticationSucceeded`|`onAuthenticationSucceeded`|
|[`Member`](api:SilverStripe\Security\Member)|`beforeMemberLoggedIn`|`onBeforeMemberLoggedIn`|
|[`Member`](api:SilverStripe\Security\Member)|`beforeMemberLoggedOut`|`onBeforeMemberLoggedOut`|
|[`LeftAndMain`](api:SilverStripe\Admin\LeftAndMain)|`init`|`onInit`|
|[`DataObject`](api:SilverStripe\ORM\DataObject)|`flushCache`|`onFlushCache`|
|[`LostPasswordHandler`](api:SilverStripe\Security\MemberAuthenticator\LostPasswordHandler)|`forgotPassword`|`onForgotPassword`|
|[`ErrorPage`](api:SilverStripe\ErrorPage\ErrorPage)|`getDefaultRecords`|`updateDefaultRecords`|
|[`SiteTree`](api:SilverStripe\CMS\Model\SiteTree)|`MetaComponents`|`updateMetaComponents`|
|[`SiteTree`](api:SilverStripe\CMS\Model\SiteTree)|`MetaTags`|`updateMetaTags`|
|[`DataObject`](api:SilverStripe\ORM\DataObject)|`populateDefaults`|`onAfterPopulateDefaults`|
|[`Member`](api:SilverStripe\Security\Member)|`registerFailedLogin`|`onRegisterFailedLogin`|
|[`DataObject`](api:SilverStripe\ORM\DataObject)|`requireDefaultRecords`|`onRequireDefaultRecords`|
|[`DataObject`](api:SilverStripe\ORM\DataObject)|`validate`|`updateValidate`|

If you have implemented any of those methods in an [`Extension`](api:SilverStripe\Core\Extension) subclass, you will need to rename it for it to continue working.

### Strict typing for `Factory` implementations {#factory-strict-typing}

The [`Factory::create()`](api:SilverStripe\Core\Injector\Factory::create()) method now has strict typehinting. The first argument must be a string, and either `null` or an object must be returned.

One consequence of this is that you can no longer directly pass an instantiated anonymous class object into [`Injector::load()`](SilverStripe\Core\Injector\Injector::load()). Instead, you need to get the class name using [`get_class()`](https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.get-class.php) and pass that in as the class.

```php
use App\ClassToReplace;
use SilverStripe\Core\Injector\Injector;

// Use `get_class()` to get the class name for your anonymous class
$replacementClass = get_class(new class () {
    private string $property;

    public function __construct(string $value = null)
    {
        $this->property = $value;
    }
});

Injector::inst()->load([
    ClassToReplace::class => [
        'class' => $replacementClass,
    ],
]);
```

### Elemental `TopPage` class names changed {#elemental-top-page}

The class names for the `TopPage` feature in [`dnadesign/silverstripe-elemental`](https://github.com/silverstripe/silverstripe-elemental) did not follow the correct naming convention for Silverstripe CMS. The class names have been changed as follows:

|old name|new name|
|---|---|
|`DNADesign\Elemental\TopPage\DataExtension`|`DNADesign\Elemental\Extensions\TopPageElementExtension`|
|`DNADesign\Elemental\TopPage\FluentExtension`|`DNADesign\Elemental\Extensions\TopPageElementFluentExtension`|
|`DNADesign\Elemental\TopPage\SiteTreeExtension`|`DNADesign\Elemental\Extensions\TopPageSiteTreeExtension`|

If you reference any of these classes in your project or module, most likely in config if you have [`tractorcow/silverstripe-fluent`](https://github.com/tractorcow/silverstripe-fluent) installed, then you will need to update the references to the new class names.

### List interface changes {#list-interface-changes}

The [`SS_List`](api:SilverStripe\Model\List\SS_List) interface now includes the methods from the `Filterable`, `Limitable`, and `Sortable` interfaces, which have now been removed. This means that any class that implements `SS_List` must now also implement the methods from those interfaces.

Many of the methods on `SS_List` and the classes that implement it are now strongly typed. This means that you will need to ensure that any custom classes that implement `SS_List` have the correct types for the methods that they implement.

### General changes {#api-general}

- [`DataObject::write()`](api:SilverStripe\ORM\DataObject::write()) has a new boolean `$skipValidation` parameter. This can be useful for scenarios where you want to automatically create a new record with no data initially without restricting how developers can set up their validation rules.
- [`FieldList`](api:SilverStripe\Forms\FieldList) is now strongly typed. Methods that previously allowed any iterable variables to be passed, namely [`FieldList::addFieldsToTab()`](api:SilverStripe\Forms\FieldList::addFieldsToTab()) and [`FieldList::removeFieldsFromTab()`](api:SilverStripe\Forms\FieldList::removeFieldsFromTab()), now require an array to be passed instead.
- [`BaseElement::getDescription()`](api:DNADesign\Elemental\Models\BaseElement::getDescription()) has been removed. If you had implemented this method in your custom elemental blocks, either set the [`description`](api:DNADesign\Elemental\Models\BaseElement->description) configuration property or override the [`getTypeNice()`](api:DNADesign\Elemental\Models\BaseElement::getTypeNice()) method.
- [`DataExtension`](api:SilverStripe\ORM\DataExtension), [`SiteTreeExtension`](api:SilverStripe\CMS\Model\SiteTreeExtension), and [`LeftAndMainExtension`](api:SilverStripe\Admin\LeftAndMainExtension) have been removed. If you subclass any of these classes, you must now subclass [`Extension`](api:SilverStripe\Core\Extension) instead.

## Other changes

### MySQL 5 no longer supported {#mysql-5-support}

MySQL 5.6 and 5.7 are no longer supported. The minimum supported version is MySQL 8.0. We support and test against the latest LTS releases of MySQL and MariaDB.

### MySQL now defaults to utf8mb4 {#mysql-utf8mb4}

MySQL will now use `utf8mb4` by default rather than plain `utf8`. This provides better support for emojis and other special characters.

Depending on when you created your Silverstripe CMS project, you may already be using `utf8mb4` as the default encoding. The `silverstripe/recipe-core` recipe has included a configuration file setting your database settings to `utf8mb4` for a few years.

When upgrading your Silverstripe CMS project, review the `app/_config/mysite.yml` file and remove the following lines if they exist:

```yml
# UTF8MB4 has limited support in older MySQL versions.
# Remove this configuration if you experience issues.
---
Name: myproject-database
---
SilverStripe\ORM\Connect\MySQLDatabase:
  connection_charset: utf8mb4
  connection_collation: utf8mb4_unicode_ci
  charset: utf8mb4
  collation: utf8mb4_unicode_ci
```

### `DBDecimal` default value {#dbdecimal-default-value}

Previously if an invalid default value was provided for a [`DBDecimal`](api:SilverStripe\ORM\FieldType\DBDecimal) database column, it would silently set the defalt value to `0`. This will now throw an exception instead, so that you're aware your configured value is invalid and can correct it.

### `RedirectorPage` validation

[`RedirectorPage`](api:SilverStripe\CMS\Model\RedirectorPage) now uses the [`Url` constraint](https://symfony.com/doc/current/reference/constraints/Url.html) from `symfony/validator` to validate the `ExternalURL` field. It will no longer add `http://` to the start of URLs for you if you're missing a protocol - instead, a validation error message will be displayed.
