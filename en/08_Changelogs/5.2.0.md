## Security considerations {#security-considerations}

This release includes several security fixes. Review the individual vulnerability disclosure for more detailed descriptions of each security fix. We highly encourage upgrading your project to include the latest security patches.

We have provided a severity rating of the vulnerabilities below based on the CVSS score. Note that the impact of each vulnerability could vary based on the specifics of each project. You can [read the severity rating definitions in the Silverstripe CMS release process](/contributing/release_process/#severity-rating).

- [CVE-2023-49783 - No permission checks for editing or deleting records with CSV import form](https://www.silverstripe.org/download/security-releases/cve-2023-49783) Severity: Medium
  - If you implement a custom subclass of [`BulkLoader`](api:SilverStripe\Dev\BulkLoader) or you're using a `BulkLoader` directly in your code, there may be additional actions you need to take to secure your project.
- [CVE-2023-48714 - Record titles for restricted records can be viewed if exposed by GridFieldAddExistingAutocompleter](https://www.silverstripe.org/download/security-releases/cve-2023-48714) Severity: Medium
- [CVE-2023-44401 - View permissions are bypassed for paginated lists of ORM data in GraphQL queries](https://www.silverstripe.org/download/security-releases/cve-2023-44401) Severity: Medium

## Official support for `silverstripe/linkfield` {#linkfield}

[`silverstripe/linkfield`](https://github.com/silverstripe/silverstripe-linkfield) 4.0.0 has been released and is now a commercially supported module.

That means it is now covered by our [minor release policy](/project_governance/minor_release_policy/), our [major release policy](/project_governance/major_release_policy/), and our [security release process](/contributing/managing_security_issues).

This module provides a [`Link`](api:SilverStripe\LinkField\Models\Link) model and two new form fields: [`LinkField`](api:SilverStripe\LinkField\Form\LinkField) and [`MultiLinkField`](api:SilverStripe\LinkField\Form\MultiLinkField). The intention of the module is to provide a clear and consistent approach to managing links in the CMS.

This release of the module includes a bunch of features that were missing from earlier versions including:

- Support for `has_many` relations
- Versioned support
- Validation
- The ability to declare which link types are allowed per field
- Improved UI including better keyboard navigation.

> [!NOTE]
> `silverstripe/linkfield` 4.0.0 requires `silverstripe/framework` 5.2.0 or higher due to its reliance on some new API.

You can install it as soon as you update your project.

```bash
composer require silverstripe/linkfield
```

Check out [the linkfield documentation](/optional_features/linkfield/) which includes guides to migrate from similar modules that you might already be using.

## Features and enhancements

### New ORM features {#new-orm-features}

This release comes jampacked with new ORM features, granting you access to some new abstractions for more powerful and efficient queries.

#### Manipulating eager loaded relation queries {#eager-loading}

Filtering or sorting an [`EagerLoadedList`](api:SilverStripe\ORM\EagerLoadedList) (i.e. after the eager loading query has been executed) requires filtering in PHP, which is less powerful and significantly slower than performing those manipulations on `DataList` before executing the query. For example, you can't filter or sort `EagerLoadedList` by fields on relations using dot notation (e.g. `sort('MySubRelation.Title')` won't work).

To alleviate this problem, we've introduced a new syntax for eager loading relations that lets you manipulate the eager loading queries.

The old syntax is still supported, because it can be used in templates for simple scenarios.

In a test setup with looping through 100 records each with 100 related records (for a total of 10,000 records per test run), the following performance improvements were observed for different types of relations (early manipulations in the database vs manipulating results in PHP):

- HasMany - ~581% faster (0.1080s vs 0.7358s)
- ManyMany - ~612% faster (0.1264s vs 0.9002s)
- ManyManyThrough - ~327% faster (0.2511s vs 1.0719s)

You can pass an associative array into the [`DataList::eagerLoad()`](api:SilverStripe\ORM\DataList::eagerLoad()) method, with relation chains as the keys and callbacks as the values. The callback accepts a `DataList` argument, and must return a `DataList`.

```php
use SilverStripe\ORM\DataList;

$teams = Team::get()->eagerLoad([
    'Players' => fn (DataList $list) => $list->filter(['Age:GreaterThan' => 18]),
]);
```

> [!WARNING]
> It is very important to remember to return the list in your callback function.

There are a few edge cases to be aware of with this new feature. To learn more, see [eager loading](/developer_guides/model/relations/#eager-loading).

#### Multi-relational `has_one` relations

Traditionally, if you wanted to have multiple `has_many` relations for the same class, you would have to include a separate `has_one` relation for *each* `has_many` relation.

This release includes a new `has_one` syntax to declare that your `has_one` should be allowed to handle multiple reciprocal `has_many` relations. The syntax for that is as follows:

> [!TIP]
> Multi-relational `has_one` relations *must* be polymorphic.

```php
namespace App\Model;

use SilverStripe\ORM\DataObject;
use SilverStripe\ORM\DataObjectSchema;

class MyExample extends DataObject
{
    // ...

    private static array $has_one = [
        'MyMultiRelationalRelation' => [
            // The class here is the class for the has_one - it must be polymorphic.
            'class' => DataObject::class,
            // Setting this to true is what defines this has_one relation as multi-relational
            DataObjectSchema::HAS_ONE_MULTI_RELATIONAL => true,
        ],
    ];
}
```

Multiple `has_many` relations on a single class can point to the above `has_one` relation, and they will be correctly saved and resolved when you get the relation list.

> [!WARNING]
> This new feature means sometimes the value in the associative `has_one` configuration array will be an array, rather than a class name.
> If you are relying on fetching this configuration to find the class names of `has_one` relations, consider using
> [`DataObject::hasOne()`](api:SilverStripe\ORM\DataObject::hasOne()) or [`DataObjectSchema::hasOneComponent()`](api:SilverStripe\ORM\DataObjectSchema::hasOneComponent()) instead.

See [multi-relational `has_one` in the relations docs](/developer_guides/model/relations/#multi-relational-has-one) for more details about this relation type.

#### UNION clause {#orm-union-clause}

Abstractions for the SQL `UNION` clause have been added to `SQLSelect` and `DataQuery`.

To add a `UNION` clause to an `SQLSelect`, call the [`SQLSelect::addUnion()`](api:SilverStripe\ORM\Queries\SQLSelect::addUnion()) method and pass in the `SQLSelect` query you want to combine using a union.

For the second argument, you can leave it blank for a default union (which is functionality equivalent to a distinct union in MySQL) - or you can pass in one of the `SQLSelect::UNION_ALL` or `SQLSelect::UNION_DISTINCT` constants for a `UNION ALL` or `UNION DISTINCT` clause respectively.

```php
$baseQuery = SQLSelect::create()->setFrom($tableName)->addWhere(...);
$anotherQuery = SQLSelect::create()->setFrom($tableName)->addWhere(...);
$baseQuery->addUnion($anotherQuery, SQLSelect::UNION_DISTINCT);
```

To add a `UNION` clause to an `DataQuery`, call the [`DataQuery::union()`](api:SilverStripe\ORM\DataQuery::union()) method and pass in either another `DataQuery` or an `SQLSelect` query you want to combine using a union. The same constants used for `SQLSelect` can be passed in here as well.

```php
$baseQuery = DataQuery::create(MyClass::class)->where(...);
$anotherQuery = DataQuery::create(MyClass::class)->where(...);
$baseQuery->union($anotherQuery, SQLSelect::UNION_ALL);
```

#### Common table expressions (CTE aka the WITH clause) {#orm-with-clause}

Abstractions for Common Table Expressions (aka the SQL `WITH` clause) have been added to `SQLSelect` and `DataQuery`.

Common Table Expressions are a powerful tool both for optimising complex queries, and for creating recursive queries. This functionality is abstracted in the [`SQLSelect::addWith()`](api:SilverStripe\ORM\Queries\SQLSelect::addWith()) and [`DataQuery::with()`](api:SilverStripe\ORM\DataQuery::with()) methods.

Older database servers don't support this functionality, and the core implementation is only valid for MySQL, so if you are using this functionality in an open source module or a project that you can't guarantee the type and version of database being used, you should wrap the query in a condition checking if CTEs are supported. You can do that by calling [`DB::get_conn()->supportsCteQueries()`](api:SilverStripe\ORM\Connect\Database::supportsCteQueries()).

Check out the [SQL Queries](/developer_guides/model/sql_select/#cte) and [Data Model and ORM](/developer_guides/model/data_model_and_orm/#cte) documentation for usage details and examples.

#### RIGHT JOIN clause {#orm-right-join}

Abstractions for `RIGHT JOIN` have been added with the new [`DataList::rightJoin()`](api:SilverStripe\ORM\DataList::rightJoin()), [`DataQuery::rightJoin()`](api:SilverStripe\ORM\DataQuery::rightJoin()), and [`SQLConditionalExpression::addRightJoin()`](api:SilverStripe\ORM\Queries\SQLConditionalExpression::addRightJoin()) methods. The signature for these methods is identical to their `LEFT JOIN` and `INNER JOIN` counterparts.

#### Support for multiple (or no) tables in the FROM clause {#orm-from-clause}

Previously the `SQLConditionalExpression` abstraction couldn't handle multiple table names being passed into its `FROM` clause. This restriction has been removed, so you can now have queries selecting from multiple tables so long as your database supports it. If you were working around that limitation by adding an explicit comma to subsequent tables in the `FROM` clause for your queries, you'll need to remove the comma.

You can also now choose to *not* have a `FROM` clause in an `SQLSelect` query, which can be useful for setting up simple queries to be used in unit tests.

#### Better support for custom column selections in `DataQuery` {#orm-custom-columns}

When using `DataQuery`, it is possible to use collations and other raw SQL field statements as part of the query's `SELECT` clause. If these have an alias that matches the name of an existing database column, this results in an exception being thrown.

You can choose to allow those conflicts to be resolved via a [`CASE`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/en/case.html) statement. In that scenario, if the value in the database column is null, the value for your custom field statement will be used. This is enabled per query by passing `true` to the new [`DataQuery::setAllowCollidingFieldStatements()`](api:SilverStripe\ORM\DataQuery::setAllowCollidingFieldStatements()) method.

```php
$query = new DataQuery(MyClass::class);
$query->selectField('"my custom title" AS "Title"');
$query->setAllowCollidingFieldStatements(true);
```

### GridField components now work with arbitrary data {#gridfield-arbitrary-data}

It has historically been difficult to use a `GridField` to display data that isn't represented by `DataObject` records - and even more difficult to edit that data.

We have removed several barriers to using the `GridField` to display arbitrary data. Descriptive exceptions will be thrown when specific information cannot be dynamically identified, such as which columns to display and what form fields to use when viewing or editing data. Note that these new exceptions do not break backwards compatibility. Any scenario that will throw an exception now would have already done so - but the old exception would not have been sufficiently descriptive to quickly understand what changes are required to get a functioning `GridField`.

This applies to all `GridFieldComponent` classes in `silverstripe/framework` except for [`GridFieldAddExistingAutocompleter`](api:SilverStripe\Forms\GridField\GridFieldAddExistingAutocompleter) and [`GridFieldLevelup`](api:SilverStripe\Forms\GridField\GridFieldLevelup), which both explicitly require the model class for the associated `GridField` to be a subclass of `DataObject`.

See [using `GridField` with arbitrary data](/developer_guides/forms/using_gridfield_with_arbitrary_data/) for more information.

### ErrorPage allowed codes configuration

By default, all available error codes are present in the dropdown in the CMS. This can be overwhelming and there are a few (looking at you, 418) that can
be confusing. To that end, you can limit the codes in the dropdown with the config value `allowed_error_codes` like so:

```yml
SilverStripe\ErrorPage\ErrorPage:
  allowed_error_codes:
    - 400
    - 403
    - 404
    - 500
```

### Create random passwords for new users

If a new user is created in the security section of the CMS with an empty password, then a strong random password will now be automatically assigned to the user which will not be visible to the person creating the user. The user will need to click the "I've forgotten my password" link in order to receive a password reset email so they can then enter a new password.

This is a behavioural change from the change introduced in Silverstripe CMS 5.1 where blank passwords were disallowed when creating a new user. This change in 5.1 meant the administrator setting up the user could know what the users password was until the user changed it. Prior to 5.1, blank passwords were allowed though users were unable to log in using them when the default Silverstripe member authenticator was used, thus forcing the user to reset their password.

This only applies to users created through the security section of the CMS. Users created programatically with an empty password will not have a random password automatically assigned to them. This is the current behaviour and is often used for non-production purposes such as unit-testing.

### Buttons to select all files and deselect all files {#bulk-action-buttons}

The files section of the CMS now has buttons to select and deselect all files and folders currently on the screen, which is useful when you want to perform bulk operations. These buttons show at the bottom of the screen in the bulk actions toolbar. The deselect all button also shows the number of currently selected items. As these buttons are on the bulk actions toolbar they are only visible if at least one item has been selected.

![select all functionality in the CMS](../_images/asset-admin-select-all.png)

### Support for validation using `symfony/validator`{#symfony-validator}

A new [`ConstraintValidator`](api:SilverStripe\Core\Validation\ConstraintValidator) class has been added which provides an abstraction around [`symfony/validator`](https://symfony.com/doc/current/components/validator.html), so you can easily validate values against symfony's validation constraints and get a [`ValidationResult`](api:SilverStripe\ORM\ValidationResult) object as a result.

```php
use SilverStripe\Core\Validation\ConstraintValidator;

/**
 * @var \Symfony\Component\Validator\Constraint $constraint
 * @var \SilverStripe\ORM\ValidationResult $result
 */
$result = ConstraintValidator::validate($valueToValidate, $constraint);
```

To test if a URL is valid, for example:

```php
use SilverStripe\Core\Validation\ConstraintValidator;
use Symfony\Component\Validator\Constraints\Url;

$isValid = ConstraintValidator::validate($url, new Url())->isValid();
```

You can use most of the constraints listed in Symfony's [supported constraints](https://symfony.com/doc/current/reference/constraints.html) documentation, though note that some of them require additional symfony dependencies.

We explicitly don't support validation using constraints that rely on `symfony/doctrine`.

### New searchable dropdown fields {#searchable-dropdown-field}

A pair of new dropdown form fields have been added which are particularly useful for dropdowns with a large number of options.

[`SearchableDropdownField`](api:SilverStripe\Forms\SearchableDropdownField) is similar to [`DropdownField`](api:SilverStripe\Forms\DropdownField) which allows selecting a single option, and [`SearchableMultiDropdownField`](api:SilverStripe\Forms\SearchableMultiDropdownField) is similar to [`ListboxField`](api:SilverStripe\Forms\ListboxField) which allows selecting multiple options.

Both of these fields include a `setIsLazyLoaded()` method which will load a limited number of options at a time using an AJAX request matching what a user has typed in. There are quite a few options to customise these, including optionally using `SearchContext` to power the lazy-loaded search functionality. We encourage you to look at the API documentation for these new classes to see what you can do with them.

Note that these are both powered by react components, and are only intended to be used within the CMS. If you want to use them on the front-end of your project you will need to provide your own templates and JavaScript implementation for them.

### New `UrlField` {#urlfield}

A new [`UrlField`](api:SilverStripe\Forms\UrlField) has been added which is a subclass of [`TextField`](api:SilverStripe\Forms\TextField) with some additional validation rules. It will validate that the value entered is a valid absolute URL with a protocol and a host.

#### Auto scaffolding of `has_one` relations

A `SearchableDropdownField` will now be used when automatically scaffolding `has_one` relations on a form in the CMS. Previously a `DropdownField` was used, and when there were over 100 items a [`NumericField`](api:SilverStripe\Forms\NumericField) was used which was not user friendly.

Previously the [`DBForeignKey.dropdown_field_threshold`](api:SilverStripe\ORM\FieldType\DBForeignKey->dropdown_field_threshold) config property was used as the threshold of the number of options to decide when to switch between auto-scaffolding a `DropdownField` and a `NumericField`. This configuration property is now used as the threshold of the number of options to decide when to start using lazy-loading for the `SearchableDropdownField`.

### Create file variants with different extensions {#file-variants}

A low-level API has been added which allows the creation of file variants with a different extension than the original extension. A file variant is a manipulated version of the original file - for example if you resize an image or convert a file to another format, this will generate a variant (leaving the original file intact).

Some examples of when you might want this are:

- Generating thumbnails for videos, documents, etc
- Converting images to `.webp` for faster page load times
- Converting documents to `.pdf` so downloaded documents are more portable

See [file manipulation](/developer_guides/files/file_manipulation/#convert-a-file-to-a-different-format) for details about how to use this new API.

### More nuanced permissions for `/dev/*` routes {#dev-route-permissions}

Previously, all `/dev/*` routes registered with [`DevelopmentAdmin`](api:SilverStripe\Dev\DevelopmentAdmin) (for example `/dev/tasks/MyBuildTask`) could only be access by administrator users, and this couldn't be configured.

Now, all of the controllers which handle these routes that come packaged in a core or supported module have a new `init_permissions` configuration property (e.g. [`TaskRunner.init_permissions`](api:SilverStripe\Dev\TaskRunner->init_permissions)). This new configuration can be used to grant non-administrative users access to these routes.

You can also now optionally implement a `canView()` method on your `BuildTask` implementations to restrict accessed for specific tasks even further. This means you can grant access to *some* tasks to specific users or groups without granting access to *all* tasks.

### Generic typehints {#generics}

Typehints using PHPStan-style generic types have been added to PHPDocs in many areas of the codebase of supported modules. The primary goal of this is to improve the developer experience by correctly reporting to your IDE what types it should expect, for example when looping through a `DataList`. In many cases your IDE will now know what types to expect without needing you to prompt it with [`@var` annotation comments](https://docs.phpdoc.org/3.0/guide/references/phpdoc/tags/var.html).

> [!NOTE]
> There are some cases where this goal conflicts with having types that are correctly identified by PHPStan itself (or other static analysis tools). For example conditional return types aren't supported as widely in IDEs as generics themselves are, so we opted to not use conditional return types even when those would result in a more accurate type for static analysis tools.

While you should see some improvements immediately after updating, there are some changes you can make to your own codebase to best use the new generic type hints.

See [Generics By Examples | PHPStan](https://phpstan.org/blog/generics-by-examples) and [Generics in PHP using PHP DocComments | DEVSENSE](https://blog.devsense.com/2022/generics-in-php-using-phpdoc) for more information about PHP generic typehints.

#### Generic typehints when returning lists {#generics-return-lists}

In your project code, any time you return an instance of `SS_List` (such as a `DataList` or `ArrayList`), you can add a generic typehint to declare what kind of object the returned list contains. This example will hint to the IDE that it returns a `DataList` containing `CarouselItem` records:

```php
use App\Model\CarouselItem;
use SilverStripe\ORM\DataList;

/**
 * @return DataList<CarouselItem>
 */
function getCarouselItems(): DataList
{
    return CarouselItem::get();
}
```

#### Generic typehints in `Extension` subclasses {#generics-extensions}

The generic typing on the `Extension` class can be used to tell your IDE what type to expect for the [`$owner`](api:SilverStripe\Core\Extension->owner) property and [`getOwner()`](api:SilverStripe\Core\Extension::getOwner()) method.

For this to be useful, you need to tell your IDE that your subclass `@extends` the `Extension` class, and tell it what type the owner should be.

> [!WARNING]
> Don't forget to include a `use` statement, even if you're not explicitly referencing the type anywhere in your actual code. Your IDE needs the `use` statement to resolve the FQCN for the class you're referencing in the typehint.

```php
namespace App\Extension;

use SilverStripe\Core\Extension;
use SilverStripe\SiteConfig\SiteConfig;

/**
 * @extends Extension<SiteConfig>
 */
class SiteConfigExtension extends Extension
{
    // ...
}
```

This is also a useful way to indicate to developers at a glance what type(s) the extension is designed to be applied to.

For example you might have an extension that can apply to any `SiteTree` class, or to `LeftAndMain` and `GridFieldDetailForm_ItemRequest` classes, which you can indicate using a union typehint: `@extends Extension<LeftAndMain|GridFieldDetailForm_ItemRequest>`.

#### Generic typehints in `ContentController` subclasses {#generics-contentcontroller}

If you use the [`data()`](api:SilverStripe\CMS\Controllers\ContentController::data()) method or the [`$dataRecord`](api:SilverStripe\CMS\Controllers\ContentController->dataRecord) property in your page controllers, you may find it useful for your IDE to know specifically what page class that data represents.

For this to work, you need to make sure your base `PageController` class has a `@template` type to extend. Any time you use `@extends`, the class being extended needs to have a `@template` type so that your IDE knows what the type you're passing in is going to be used for.

```php
namespace {

    use SilverStripe\CMS\Controllers\ContentController;

    /**
     * @template T of Page
     * @extends ContentController<T>
     */
    class PageController extends ContentController
    {
        // ...
    }
}
```

```php
namespace App\PageType;

use PageController;

/**
 * @extends PageController<HomePage>
 */
class HomepageController extends PageController
{
    // ...
}
```

### New exception in react forms {#react-forms-exception}

A [`LogicException`](https://www.php.net/manual/en/class.logicexception.php) is now thrown by [`FormSchema::getSchema()`](api:SilverStripe\Forms\Schema::getSchema()) if a react component was not found for a field type.

> [!WARNING]
> If your project or a module you're using is currently trying to include a field which doesn't have a react component into a react-rendered form, it will have been silently failing. The form will have been rendering everything except for the field(s) which have no react component.
>
> This will now fail by throwing an exception, which means your form won't render at all until you remove or replace the field(s).

### Other new features

- A new [`SiteTree.hide_pagetypes`](api:SilverStripe\CMS\Model\SiteTree->hide_pagetypes) configuration property has been added. Unlike [`SiteTree.hide_ancestor`](api:SilverStripe\CMS\Model\SiteTree->hide_ancestor) (which has [now been deprecated](#api-silverstripe-cms)), this is an array. This allows you to define all page types that should be hidden in a single configuration property in your YAML configuration.
- A new [`DBText.summary_sentence_separators`](api:SilverStripe\ORM\FieldType\DBText->summary_sentence_separators) configuration property has been added. This is used to split sentences in the [`DBText::Summary()`](api:SilverStripe\ORM\FieldType\DBText::Summary()) method. The default configuration value includes `.`, `!`, and `?`. Previously, only `.` was used to split sentences.
- You can now upload [Braille ASCII file format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Braille_ASCII) (`.brf`) files to the CMS without needing to modify the [allowed file types](/developer_guides/files/allowed_file_types/).
- The assets admin section now respects the [`Upload_Validator.default_max_file_size`](api:SilverStripe\Assets\Upload_Validator->default_max_file_size) configuration if [`AssetAdmin.max_upload_size`](api:SilverStripe\AssetAdmin\Controller\AssetAdmin->max_upload_size) has not been explicitly set for your project. Previously, asset admin would ignore `Upload_Validator.default_max_file_size` and just use the PHP `upload_max_filesize` ini configuration by default.
- Redirector pages with a link to a missing or unpublished page/file will now return a 404 response. You can revert to the previous behaviour by setting the [`RedirectorPageController.missing_redirect_is_404`](api:SilverStripe\CMS\Model\RedirectorPageController->missing_redirect_is_404) configuration property to `false`.
- Developers can now opt in to including a comment on all ORM database queries indicating where they were executed from. See [debugging database queries](/developer_guides/debugging/#debugging-database-queries) for details.

## API changes

### `silverstripe/framework` {#api-silverstripe-framework}

The following legacy subclasses of [`PasswordEncryptor`](api:SilverStripe\Security\PasswordEncryptor) have been deprecated, and will be removed in a future major release. If you are using one of these password encryptors in your projects, we strongly recommend swapping to one that has not been deprecated ([`PasswordEncryptor_Blowfish`](api:SilverStripe\Security\PasswordEncryptor_Blowfish) is the current recommendation, and is the default encryptor for passwords in new installations). Note that changing the password encryptor will also require that all of your members reset their passwords.

- [`PasswordEncryptor_None`](api:SilverStripe\Security\PasswordEncryptor_None)
- [`PasswordEncryptor_LegacyPHPHash`](api:SilverStripe\Security\PasswordEncryptor_LegacyPHPHash)
- [`PasswordEncryptor_MySQLOldPassword`](api:SilverStripe\Security\PasswordEncryptor_MySQLOldPassword)
- [`PasswordEncryptor_MySQLPassword`](api:SilverStripe\Security\PasswordEncryptor_MySQLPassword)

The following unused API have been deprecated and will be removed in a future major release:

- Configuration property [`DataObject.subclass_access`](api:SilverStripe\ORM\DataObject->subclass_access)
- Public static method [`DataObject::disable_subclass_access()`](api:SilverStripe\ORM\DataObject::disable_subclass_access())
- Public static method [`DataObject::enable_subclass_access()`](api:SilverStripe\ORM\DataObject::enable_subclass_access())

The [`ViewableData::getIterator()`](api:SilverStripe\View\ViewableData::getIterator()) method has been deprecated and will be removed in a future major release.

### `silverstripe/cms` {#api-silverstripe-cms}

The [`SiteTree.hide_ancestor`](api:SilverStripe\CMS\Model\SiteTree->hide_ancestor) configuration property has been deprecated. Use [`SiteTree.hide_pagetypes`](api:SilverStripe\CMS\Model\SiteTree->hide_pagetypes) instead.

### `silverstripe/versioned` {#api-silverstripe-versioned}

The `$having` parameter in the [`Versioned::Versions()`](api:SilverStripe\Versioned\Versioned::Versions()) method has been deprecated. This parameter was never used, and has been removed from the method signature.
