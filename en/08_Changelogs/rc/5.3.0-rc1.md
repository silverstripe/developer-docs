## Release candidate

This version of Silverstripe CMS is a **release candidate** for an upcoming stable version, and should not be applied to production websites. We encourage developers to test this version in development / testing environments and [report any issues they encounter via GitHub](/contributing/issues_and_bugs/).

## Security considerations {#security-considerations}

Three security fixes that were previously released in the July security release are mentioned in the [Silverstripe CMS security patches July 2024](https://www.silverstripe.org/blog/silverstripe-cms-security-patches-july-2024/) blog post are listed below.

Review the individual vulnerability disclosure for more detailed descriptions of each security fix. We highly encourage upgrading your project to include the latest security patches.

We have provided a severity rating of the vulnerabilities below based on the CVSS score. Note that the impact of each vulnerability could vary based on the specifics of each project. You can [read the severity rating definitions in the Silverstripe CMS release process](/contributing/release_process/#severity-rating).

- [CVE-2024-29885 - Reports are still accessible even when canView is set to false](https://www.silverstripe.org/download/security-releases/cve-2024-29885) Severity: Medium
- [CVE-2024-32981 - XSS Vulnerability with text/html base64-encoded payload](https://www.silverstripe.org/download/security-releases/cve-2024-32981) Severity: Medium

## Features and enhancements

### Changes to `TinyMCEConfig` {#changes-to-tinymce}

In order to facilitate fixing a bug related to the sanitisation of HTML content via the [`HTMLEditorSanitiser`](api:SilverStripe\Forms\HTMLEditor\HTMLEditorSanitiser) class, some changes had to be made to the [`TinyMCEConfig`](api:SilverStripe\Forms\HTMLEditor\TinyMCEConfig) class. Those changes are as follows:

- If `valid_elements` and `extended_valid_elements` are both empty, all HTML elements will be stripped out of the HTML content.
- A default set of `valid_elements` has been defined for all `TinyMCEConfig` instances. If you use custom `TinyMCEConfig` definitions and have not explicitly set the `valid_elements` option, you may have more elements permitted than you were expecting.
- There is a new [`TinyMCEConfig.default_options`](api:SilverStripe\Forms\HTMLEditor\TinyMCEConfig->default_options) configuration property which allows you to define the default options for all `TinyMCEConfig` instances.

> [!WARNING]
> If you use custom `TinyMCEConfig` definitions, we strongly recommend double checking if they include a definition of `valid_elements`, and if they don't, validate whether the default set defined in `TinyMCEConfig.default_options` is suitable for you.
>
> You can either change the `TinyMCEConfig.default_options` configuration value to affect the options for all `TinyMCEConfig` definitions, or explicitly define `valid_elements` for your specific configuration instances. See [setting options](/developer_guides/forms/field_types/htmleditorfield/#setting-options) for more details.

See [sanitisation of HTML](#sanitisation-of-html) for more information about the bug that was fixed.

### High-level API for converting files {#file-converter}

There is now a high-level API for converting files from one format to another. This builds on top of the low-level API which was [added in 5.2.0](/changelogs/5.2.0/#file-variants).

Files can be converted both in PHP code and in templates:

```php
// Convert an image to webp format and apply the FitMax manipulation to the result
$this->MyImage()->Convert('webp')->FitMax(100, 100);
```

```ss
<%-- Convert an image to webp format and apply the FitMax manipulation to the result --%>
$MyImage.Convert('webp').FitMax(100, 100)
```

Out of the box `silverstripe/assets` provides the new [`InterventionImageFileConverter`](api:SilverStripe\Assets\Conversion\InterventionImageFileConverter) class which converts images to other image formats using [Intervention Image](https://image.intervention.io/v2). You can add your own `FileConverter` implementations in projects or modules for any file convertions you might need.

See [convert a file to a different format](/developer_guides/files/file_manipulation/#file-conversion) for more details.

### Improve customisability of rendered images {#image-rendering}

We've aligned how images added to an [`HTMLEditorField`](api:SilverStripe\Forms\HTMLEditor\HTMLEditorField) and images invoked in templates are rendered. The markup up for both `<img>` tags are now generated from the same template file. This makes it easier to customise how images are rendered on your site.

The template for this is `templates/SilverStripe/Assets/Storage/DBFile_Image.ss`. Add a file with that path to your Silverstripe CMS theme if you want to override it.

This opens many interesting possibilities. For example, this code snippet will provide a WebP version of any image rendered on your site.

```html
<picture>
    <source srcset="$Convert('webp').Link" type="image/webp">
    <img $AttributesHTML >
</picture>
```

You can also choose to have different rendering logic for `HTMLEditorField` images and for images invoked in templates by overriding different templates.

- Add a `SilverStripe/Assets/Shortcodes/ImageShortcodeProvider_Image.ss` to your theme to control images added to an HTMLEditorField.
- Add a `DBFile_Image.ss` file to the root of your theme to control only images invoked in templates.

### Validation for inline-editable elemental blocks {#elemental-validation}

Elemental content blocks now support validation when saving or publishing individual content blocks using the "three-dot" context menu in the top-right of the block.

Validation can be added to a content block using standard [Model Validation and Constraints](https://docs.silverstripe.org/en/5/developer_guides/model/validation/#validation-and-constraints) by implementing a [`DataObject::validate()`](api:SilverStripe\ORM\DataObject::validate()) method on a content block, or by using [Form Validation](https://docs.silverstripe.org/en/5/developer_guides/forms/validation/#form-validation) where there are several options available.

Elemental data is no longer sent when saving the parent `DataObject` (usually a `Page`) that contains an [`ElementalAreaField`](api:DNADesign\Elemental\Forms\ElementalAreaField). Instead, when saving the parent `DataObject`, all the child inline-editable elements that have unsaved changes are inline saved at the same time. This change was done to consolidate the saving process down to a single code path. The code that was previously used to process any element data sent with the parent data has been removed.

### `FormField` scaffolding for `DataObject` models {#scaffolding}

We've made a few improvements to how form fields are scaffolded for [`DataObject::getCMSFields()`](api:SilverStripe\ORM\DataObject::getCMSFields()).

#### Define scaffolded form fields for relations {#scaffolding-relation-formfields}

Most `DataObject` classes will rely on some amount of automatic scaffolding of form fields in their `getCMSFields()` implementations. However, it's common for modules to provide a specialised form field which is intended to always be used with a specific `DataObject` class. In those cases, even though you always want to use that form field with that class, you have to copy some boilerplate code from the module's documentation to set it up.

You can now define what form fields should be used when scaffolding form fields for `has_one`, `has_many`, and `many_many` relations. This is defined on the class on the child-side of the relationship. For example, for the below `has_one` relation you would implement [`scaffoldFormFieldForHasOne()`](api:SilverStripe\ORM\DataObject::scaffoldFormFieldForHasOne()) on the `MyChild` class.

```php
namespace App\Model;

use SilverStripe\ORM\DataObject;

class MyParent extends DataObject
{
    // ...
    private static array $has_one = [
        'MyChild' => MyChild::class,
    ];
}
```

```php
namespace App\Model;

use SilverStripe\Forms\FormField;
use SilverStripe\ORM\DataObject;

class MyChild extends DataObject
{
    // ...

    public function scaffoldFormFieldForHasOne(
        string $fieldName,
        ?string $fieldTitle,
        string $relationName,
        DataObject $ownerRecord
    ): FormField {
        return /* instantiate some FormField here */;
    }
}
```

This means modules can pre-define the form field that should be used for their custom models, which reduces the amount of boilerplate code developers need to include in their `getCMSFields()` implementations.

For more information see [scaffolding for relations](/developer_guides/model/scaffolding/#scaffolding-for-relations).

#### `FormScaffolder` options {#scaffolding-options}

The [`FormScaffolder`](api:SilverStripe\Forms\FormScaffolder) class (which is responsible for scaffolding form fields for `getCMSFields()`) has some new options:

|option|description|
|---|---|
|`mainTabOnly`|Only set up the "Root.Main" tab, but skip scaffolding actual form fields or relation tabs. If `tabbed` is false, the `FieldList` will be empty.|
|`ignoreFields`|Deny list of field names. If populated, database fields and fields representing `has_one` relations which *are* in this array won't be scaffolded.|
|`ignoreRelations`|Deny list of field names. If populated, form fields representing `has_many` and `many_many` relations which *are* in this array won't be scaffolded.|
|`restrictRelations`|Allow list of field names. If populated, form fields representing `has_many` and `many_many` relations not in this array won't be scaffolded.|

In particular, the `ignoreFields` and `ignoreRelations` options are useful ways to prevent form fields from being scaffolded at all. You can use this instead of calling `$fields->removeFieldByName()`, for example if you are adding database fields that you don't want to be edited with form fields in the CMS.

These options are now also configurable using the new [`DataObject.scaffold_cms_fields_settings`](api:SilverStripe\ORM\DataObject->scaffold_cms_fields_settings) configuration property.

See the [scaffolding](/developer_guides/model/scaffolding/#scaffolding-options) section for more details.

### Support for `JOIN` in SQL `UPDATE` {#sql-update-join}

The [`SQLUpdate`](api:SilverStripe\ORM\Queries\SQLUpdate) class now supports all of the same `JOIN` operations (using the same methods) that [`SQLSelect`](api:SilverStripe\ORM\Queries\SQLSelect) does.

This is particularly helpful if you need to update columns in one table to match values from another table.

### Autologin token regeneration changes {#autologin-token-regeneration}

The Autologin ('remember me') feature stores cookies in the user's browser to allow recreation of their session when it expires. Currently, one of the cookies is regenerated whenever a user's session is recreated. This can cause unexpected logouts in certain situations, and has minimal value from a security standpoint.

In 5.3, the current behaviour is retained, but can be disabled via configuration:

```yml
SilverStripe\Security\RememberLoginHash:
  replace_token_during_session_renewal: false
```

This will cause the token to be generated once during login, and not be regenerated during session renewal.

From 6.0 onwards, tokens will never be regenerated during session renewal, and this configuration will be removed.

### Other new features

- `silverstripe/linkfield` now has improved accessibility support for screen readers and keyboard navigation. Focus states have also been made consistent between keyboard and mouse interaction.
- `silverstripe/graphql-devtools` contains a new `GraphQLSchemaInitTask` to help you initialise a basic GraphQL schema.
- [`GridFieldDetailForm_ItemRequest`](api:SilverStripe\Forms\GridField\GridFieldDetailForm_ItemRequest) now uses a [`PjaxResponseNegotiator`](api:SilverStripe\Control\PjaxResponseNegotiator) to handle PJAX responses for the save and publish actions. This aligns it with responses from other form submissions in the CMS.
- Primitive types inside an iterable object will now be automatically converted to relevant [`DBField`](api:SilverStripe\ORM\FieldType\DBField) types so can be rendered in a template. This allows the use of `return ArrayList::create(['lorem', 123]);` from a [`ContentController`](api:SilverStripe\CMS\Controllers\ContentController) method that is then looped over in a template.
- A new [`TabSet::changeTabOrder()`](api:SilverStripe\Forms\TabSet::changeTabOrder()) method has been added that allows you to change the order of tabs in a `TabSet`. See [tabbed forms](/developer_guides/forms/tabbed_forms/#change-the-order-of-tabs) for details.

## API changes

- Passing a non-array `$fields` argument to both [`FieldList::addFieldsToTab()`](api:SilverStripe\Forms\FieldList::addFieldsToTab()) and [`FieldList::removeFieldsFromTab()`](api:SilverStripe\Forms\FieldList::removeFieldsFromTab()) has been deprecated.
- The [`BaseElement::getDescription()`](api:DNADesign\Elemental\Models\BaseElement::getDescription()) method has been deprecated. To update or get the CMS description of elemental blocks, use the [`description`](api:DNADesign\Elemental\Models\BaseElement->description) configuration property and the localisation API.
- The [`RememberLoginHash::renew()`](api:SilverStripe\Security\RememberLoginHash::renew()) method has been deprecated without replacement, since the associated behaviour will be removed in 6.0.
  - The `onAfterRenewToken` extension point within this method will likely be replaced with a new extension point in 6.0.
- The [`RememberLoginHash.replace_token_during_session_renewal`](api:SilverStripe\Security\RememberLoginHash->replace_token_during_session_renewal) configuration property has been added to allow disabling token regeneration during session renewal. This property will be removed in 6.0.
- Code for the CMS GraphQL `admin` schema which provided endpoints for the CMS has been deprecated and will be removed in CMS 6. Functionality which the GraphQL endpoints are currently responsible for will be replaced with regular Silverstripe controller endpoints instead. Extension hooks will be added to the new controller endpoints that return data to allow for customisation. Frontend schemas, such the `default` schema, will continue to work in CMS 6.
- [`IPUtils`](api:SilverStripe\Control\Util\IPUtils) has been deprecated and its usage has been replaced with the `IPUtils` class from `symfony/http-foundation` which is now included as a composer dependency in `silverstripe/framework`.
- Code in [`silverstripe/blog`](https://github.com/silverstripe/silverstripe-blog) which supported integration with [`silverstripe/widgets`](https://github.com/silverstripe/silverstripe-widgets) has been deprecated and will be removed in CMS 6.0.
- [`DataExtension`](api:SilverStripe\ORM\DataExtension), [`SiteTreeExtension`](api:SilverStripe\CMS\Model\SiteTreeExtension), and [`LeftAndMainExtension`](api:SilverStripe\Admin\LeftAndMainExtension) have been deprecated and will be removed in CMS 6.0. If you subclass any of these classes, you should now subclass [`Extension`](api:SilverStripe\Core\Extension) directly instead.

## Bug fixes

- If you use `<% loop %>` in your templates without telling it what to loop, previously the behaviour was to fail silently. This will now loop over what is currently in scope. See [looping over lists](/developer_guides/templates/syntax/#looping-over-lists) for more details.
- Reordering elemental blocks used to update the published sort order immediately, without pressing the publish button. That wasn't consistent with the way any other sort order updates happen in the CMS. We've changed this so that the sort order won't update in your published site until you publish one of the blocks in the elemental area that the reordered blocks live in. This is consistent with what happens when you reorder pages in the site tree.

This release includes a number of bug fixes to improve a broad range of areas. Check the change logs for full details of these fixes split by module. Thank you to the community members that helped contribute these fixes as part of the release!

### Sanitisation of HTML

When you save content in a `HTMLEditorField`, the [`HTMLEditorSanitiser`](api:SilverStripe\Forms\HTMLEditor\HTMLEditorSanitiser) class is responsible for ensuring the HTML content is safe and matches the `valid_elements` and `extended_valid_elements` options you've defined.

There was a bug that resulted in `HTMLEditorSanitiser` using the 'active' `HTMLEditorConfig` instance rather than the instance which was defined for the field. In many cases this goes unnoticed because the default active instance is very permissive, and TinyMCE does a lot of this work on the client-side, but it was possible to bypass the defined allowed HTML elements by sending requests directly to the server.

This bug has been fixed, but some additional changes were required to facilitate it. See [changes to `TinyMCEConfig`](#changes-to-tinymce) for more details about those changes.

### Restore batch action removed

The "Restore" batch action was removed from the batch actions dropdown menu in the CMS as it has not functioned correctly for a long time. There is no intention at this stage to reintroduce this feature.
