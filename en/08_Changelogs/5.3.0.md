## Features and enhancements

### Support for `JOIN` in SQL `UPDATE` {#sql-update-join}

The [`SQLUpdate`](api:SilverStripe\ORM\Queries\SQLUpdate) class now supports all of the same `JOIN` operations (using the same methods) that [`SQLSelect`](api:SilverStripe\ORM\Queries\SQLSelect) does.

This is particularly helpful if you need to update columns in one table to match values from another table.

### Other new features

- `silverstripe/linkfield` now has improved accessibility support for screen readers and keyboard navigation. Focus states have also been made consistent between keyboard and mouse interaction.
- `silverstripe/graphql-devtools` contains a new `GraphQLSchemaInitTask` to help you initialise a basic GraphQL schema.
