## Features and enhancements

### High-level API for converting files {#file-converter}

There is now a high-level API for converting files from one format to another. This builds on top of the low-level API which was [added in 5.2.0](/changelogs/5.2.0/#file-variants).

Files can be converted both in PHP code and in templates:

```php
// Convert an image to webp format and apply the FitMax manipulation to the result
$this->MyImage()->Convert('webp')->FitMax(100, 100);
```

```ss
<%-- Convert an image to webp format and apply the FitMax manipulation to the result --%>
$MyImage.Convert('webp').FitMax(100, 100)
```

Out of the box `silverstripe/assets` provides the new [`InterventionImageFileConverter`](api:SilverStripe\Assets\Conversion\InterventionImageFileConverter) class which converts images to other image formats using [Intervention Image](https://image.intervention.io/v2). You can add your own `FileConverter` implementations in projects or modules for any file convertions you might need.

See [convert a file to a different format](/developer_guides/files/file_manipulation/#file-conversion) for more details.

### Support for `JOIN` in SQL `UPDATE` {#sql-update-join}

The [`SQLUpdate`](api:SilverStripe\ORM\Queries\SQLUpdate) class now supports all of the same `JOIN` operations (using the same methods) that [`SQLSelect`](api:SilverStripe\ORM\Queries\SQLSelect) does.

This is particularly helpful if you need to update columns in one table to match values from another table.
