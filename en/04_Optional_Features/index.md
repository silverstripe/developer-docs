# Optional features

Silverstripe CMS can be highly customised using both supported and community-made modules. You can find these [one Packagist](https://packagist.org/?type=silverstripe-vendormodule).

This section highlights some of the CMS features provided by the [Silverstripe CMS supported modules](/project_governance/supported_modules/).
In each case you'll need to ensure you have the module installed in your project in order to use the features described here.
