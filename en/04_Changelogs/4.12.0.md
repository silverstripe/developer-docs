## Regression test and Security audit{#audit}

This release has been comprehensively regression tested and passed to a third party for a security-focused audit.

While it is still advised that you perform your own due diligence when upgrading your project, this work is performed to ensure a safe and secure upgrade with each recipe release.

## Features and enhancements {#features-and-enhancements}

### Search multiple `searchable_fields` by default {#general-search-field}

The general search text field which appears in the search interface now searches across all of your searchable fields by default. It will return a match if the search terms appear in any of the searchable fields.

If you have fields which you do _not_ want to be searched with this general search (e.g. date fields which need special consideration), you can mark them as being explicitly excluded by setting `general` to false in the searchable fields configuration for that field:

```php
use SilverStripe\ORM\DataObject;

class MyDataObject extends DataObject
{
    private static $searchable_fields = [
        'Name',
        'BirthDate' => [
            'general' => false
        ],
    ];
}
```

There is also additional configuration, such as which `SearchFilter` it uses ([PartialMatchFilter](api:SilverStripe\ORM\Filters\PartialMatchFilter) by default), and whether it should split the search query into individual search terms or search as a phrase. Check out [General search field](/developer_guides/model/scaffolding#general-search-field) for more information.

### Samesite attribute on cookies {#cookies-samesite}

The `samesite` attribute is now set on all cookies. To avoid backward compatability issues, the `Lax` value has been set by default, but we recommend reviewing the requirements of your project and setting an appropriate value.

The default value can be set for all cookies (except for the session cookie) in yaml configuration like so:

```yml
SilverStripe\Control\Cookie:
  default_samesite: 'Strict'
```

Check out the [cookies documentation](/developer_guides/cookies_and_sessions/cookies#samesite-attribute) for more information.

The session cookie is handled separately. You can configure it like so:

```yml
SilverStripe\Control\Session:
  cookie_samesite: 'Strict'
```

Note that if you set the `samesite` attribute to `None`, the `secure` is automatically set to `true` as required by the specification.

For more information about the `samesite` attribute check out https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Set-Cookie/SameSite
