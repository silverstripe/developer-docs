## Features and enhancements

### Eager loading

When looping over nested relationships the ORM is prone to the N + 1 query problem where excessive database calls are made. Eager loading has been introduced via the new `DataList::eagerLoad($relationship)` method which alleviates the N + 1 problem by querying the nested relationship tables before they are needed using a single large `WHERE ID in ($ids)` SQL query instead of many `WHERE RelationID = $id` queries.

Imagine the following example where there is a Team model with 20 records, which has_many Players

```php
// Regular ORM usage without eager loading
// This would result in 21 SQL SELECT queries, 1 for Teams and 20 for Players
$teams = Team::get();

// Using the `eagerLoad()` method to eager load data from nested models -up to 3 relations deep
// This will result is only 2 SQL SELECT queries, 1 for Teams and 1 for Players
$teams = Team::get()->eagerLoad('Players');

foreach ($teams as $team) {
    foreach ($team->Players() as $player) {
        echo $player->FirstName;
    }
}
```

### Other new features

- You can now exclude specific `DataObject` models from the check and repair step of `dev/build` - see [ORM Performance](/developer_guides/performance/orm/#skip-check-and-repair) for more information.
- You can change what `SearchFilter` the `TreeDropdownField` uses with yaml configuration - see [ORM Performance](/developer_guides/performance/orm/#treedropdownfield) for more information.
- The [`i18nTextCollector`](api:SilverStripe\i18n\TextCollection\i18nTextCollector) now collects strings for ORM properties (e.g. `$db` fields) in `DataObject` and `Extension` classes, and from themes. See [i18n - collecting text](/developer_guides/i18n/#collecting-text) for more details.
- Extensions which modify permissions for [`Group`](api:SilverStripe\Security\Group) records which return `true` will be respected, the same as when modifying permissions for any other `DataObject` record.

## API changes

- [`BuildTask`](api:SilverStripe\Dev\BuildTask) now has boolean `is_enabled` configuration option which has precedence over the existing `BuildTask::enabled` protected class property. The `BuildTask::enabled` property has been marked as deprecated and will be removed in CMS 6 if favour of using `is_enabled` instead.

## Dependency changes

- The unsupported modules `silverstripe/widgets` and `silverstripe/content-widget` were removed from `silverstripe/recipe-blog`. They were accidentally included in the `2.0.0` release of `silverstripe/recipe-blog`. The `silverstripe/widgets` and `silverstripe/content-widget` modules are CMS-5-compatible though unsupported. If your project relies on `silverstripe/widgets` or `silverstripe/content-widget`, manually update your project's `composer.json` file to explicitly require these modules.

## Bug fixes

- [`DataList::filterAny()`](api:SilverStripe\ORM\DataList::filterAny()) queries on many-many relations that use an aggregate `HAVING` clause now correctly use an `OR` conjunction rather than an incorrect `AND` conjunction.
- At some point shortly before the release of Silverstripe CMS 4.0.0, SSL support for database connections was accidentally removed. This has now been reinstated - see [Using SSL in database connections](/developer_guides/security/secure_coding#using-ssl-in-database-connections) for more information.
- The `cascade_duplicates` property was added to the [`InheritedPermissionsExtension`](api:SilverStripe\Security\InheritedPermissionsExtension) class so that now when duplicating any object that has the `InheritedPermissionsExtension` applied, the `GroupID` values in the `ViewerGroups` and `EditGroups` mapping tables will also be duplicated so that new object retains the same viewer and editor groups as the original.

This release includes a number of bug fixes to improve a broad range of areas. Check the change logs for full details of these fixes split by module. Thank you to the community members that helped contribute these fixes as part of the release!
