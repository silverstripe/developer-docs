## Features and enhancements

### Other new features
- You can now exclude specific `DataObject` models from the check and repair step of `dev/build` - see [ORM Performance](/developer_guides/performance/orm/#skip-check-and-repair) for more information.
- You can change what `SearchFilter` the `TreeDropdownField` uses with yaml configuration - see [ORM Performance](/developer_guides/performance/orm/#treedropdownfield) for more information.
- The [`i18nTextCollector`](api:SilverStripe\i18n\TextCollection\i18nTextCollector) now collects strings for ORM properties (e.g. `$db` fields) in `DataObject` and `Extension` classes, and from themes. See [i18n - collecting text](/developer_guides/i18n/#collecting-text) for more details.
- Extensions which modify permissions for [`Group`](api:SilverStripe\Security\Group) records which return `true` will be respected, the same as when modifying permissions for any other `DataObject` record.
