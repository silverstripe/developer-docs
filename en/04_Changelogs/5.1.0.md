## Bugfixes {#bugfixes}

- In CMS 5, [`SilverStripe\ORM\DataObject::duplicate()`](api:SilverStripe\ORM\DataObject::duplicate()) no longer supports passing an argument `$relation` to this method as a string, such as "many_many". Now, in order to do this, you need to pass the list of relations as an array or use `cascade_duplicates` configuration class property. 
In order to implement this logic and save groups of users who have `canEdit` and `canView` permissions on this page in a duplicate page, the `cascade_duplicates` property was added to the `SiteTree` class.
