## Features and enhancements

### Eager loading

When looping over nested relationships the ORM is prone to the N + 1 query problem where excessive database calls are made. Eager loading has been introduced via the new `DataList::eagerLoad($relationship)` method which alleviates the N + 1 problem by querying the nested relationship tables before they are needed using a single large `WHERE ID in ($ids)` SQL query instead of many `WHERE RelationID = $id` queries.

Imagine the following example where there is a Team model with 20 records, which has_many Players

```php
// Regular ORM usage without eager loading
// This would result in 21 SQL SELECT queries, 1 for Teams and 20 for Players
$teams = Team::get();

// Using the `eagerLoad()` method to eager load data from nested models -up to 3 relations deep
// This will result is only 2 SQL SELECT queries, 1 for Teams and 1 for Players
$teams = Team::get()->eagerLoad('Players');

foreach ($teams as $team) {
    foreach ($team->Players() as $player) {
        echo $player->FirstName;
    }
}
```

Read more about [eager loading](/developer_guides/model/relations/#eager-loading) in the developer docs.

### GraphQL schema can be stored in `silverstripe-cache` {#gql-schema-is-cache}

By default, the graphql schema is stored in a `.graphql-generated/` directory in your project root. It is now possible to configure this to be stored in the `silverstripe-cache` (i.e. `TEMP_PATH`) directory.

Note that even if you store the schema in the cache directory, the schema still won't be invalidated when you flush the cache. See [what triggers a GraphQL code build](/developer_guides/graphql/getting_started/building_the_schema/#what-triggers-a-graphql-code-build) for details about how to build the schema.

See [choosing where the cache is stored](/developer_guides/graphql/getting_started/building_the_schema/#cache-location) for more information about configuring the schema storage directory.

### Improvement to page search performance with Elemental {#cms-search-performance}

- The CMS search has been optimised to reduce the number of database queries made when searching for pages with elemental content blocks. This has resulted in a small performance improvement. In our test environment, with 1,000 pages each with 5 content blocks we observed a 9% performance improvement. Performance will vary with your environment.
- A new opt-in behaviour is available that makes a very large difference to performance when using elemental content blocks. In testing, this behaviour more than halved the response time of the sitetree search request. The opt-in feature disables the default behaviour of rendering all content blocks for CMS search. Instead, it simply extracts the database contents of the elements from its text and html fields. There is a downside to consider which is that any related content not directly on the element will not be matched against the search query. Note this does not use the `$searchable_fields` config. To opt-in to this behaviour, use the following config:

```yml
DNADesign\Elemental\Controllers\ElementSiteTreeFilterSearch:
  render_elements: false
```

If `render_elements` is set to `false` then individual fields on elements can be excluded from search by adding them to a config array:

```yml
App\MyElement:
  fields_excluded_from_cms_search:
    - MyFieldToExclude
    - AnotherFieldToExclude
```

### New `InheritedPermissions` option - only these members {#only-these-members}

Applying the [`InheritedPermissionsExtension`](api:SilverStripe\Security\InheritedPermissionsExtension) to a `DataObject` class gives you the ability to declare that only users in certain groups can view or edit those records. This extension is applied by default to the [`File`](api:SilverStripe\Assets\File) and [`SiteTree`](SilverStripe\CMS\Model\SiteTree) classes.

A new permission has been added to [`InheritedPermissions`](api:SilverStripe\Security\InheritedPermissions), which powers that extension. The new permission (`InheritedPermissions::ONLY_THESE_MEMBERS`) allows you to define which specific `Member` records should have access to your records, regardless of which groups those members belong to.

In the CMS, this new permission is available for files and pages by setting "Who can view/edit this page/file" to "Only these users".

### Other new features

- You can now exclude specific `DataObject` models from the check and repair step of `dev/build` - see [ORM Performance](/developer_guides/performance/orm/#skip-check-and-repair) for more information.
- You can change what `SearchFilter` the `TreeDropdownField` uses with yaml configuration - see [ORM Performance](/developer_guides/performance/orm/#treedropdownfield) for more information.
- The [`i18nTextCollector`](api:SilverStripe\i18n\TextCollection\i18nTextCollector) now collects strings for ORM properties (e.g. `$db` fields) in `DataObject` and `Extension` classes, and from themes. See [i18n - collecting text](/developer_guides/i18n/#collecting-text) for more details.
- Extensions which modify permissions for [`Group`](api:SilverStripe\Security\Group) records which return `true` will be respected, the same as when modifying permissions for any other `DataObject` record.
- The [`ListboxField`](api:SilverStripe\Forms\ListboxField) now has a react component, and can be used in react-powered contexts such as within elemental blocks

## API changes

### silverstripe/framework

- [`BuildTask`](api:SilverStripe\Dev\BuildTask) now has boolean `is_enabled` configuration option which has precedence over the existing `BuildTask::enabled` protected class property. The `BuildTask::enabled` property has been marked as deprecated and will be removed in CMS 6 if favour of using `is_enabled` instead.
- Passing an argument for `$limit` that is not `array|string|null` in [`SilverStripe\ORM\Search\SearchContext::getQuery()`](api:SilverStripe\ORM\Search\SearchContext::getQuery()) will throw a deprecation warning. In CMS 6 the parameter type will be changed from dynamic to `array|string|null`.


## Dependency changes

- The unsupported modules `silverstripe/widgets` and `silverstripe/content-widget` were removed from `silverstripe/recipe-blog`. They were accidentally included in the `2.0.0` release of `silverstripe/recipe-blog`. The `silverstripe/widgets` and `silverstripe/content-widget` modules are CMS-5-compatible though unsupported. If your project relies on `silverstripe/widgets` or `silverstripe/content-widget`, manually update your project's `composer.json` file to explicitly require these modules.

## Bug fixes

- [`DataList::filterAny()`](api:SilverStripe\ORM\DataList::filterAny()) queries on many-many relations that use an aggregate `HAVING` clause now correctly use an `OR` conjunction rather than an incorrect `AND` conjunction.
- At some point shortly before the release of Silverstripe CMS 4.0.0, SSL support for database connections was accidentally removed. This has now been reinstated - see [Using SSL in database connections](/developer_guides/security/secure_coding#using-ssl-in-database-connections) for more information.
- The `cascade_duplicates` property was added to the [`InheritedPermissionsExtension`](api:SilverStripe\Security\InheritedPermissionsExtension) class so that now when duplicating any object that has the `InheritedPermissionsExtension` applied, the `GroupID` values in the `ViewerGroups` and `EditGroups` mapping tables will also be duplicated so that new object retains the same viewer and editor groups as the original.

This release includes a number of bug fixes to improve a broad range of areas. Check the change logs for full details of these fixes split by module. Thank you to the community members that helped contribute these fixes as part of the release!
