## Features and enhancements

### New ORM features {#new-orm-features}

This release comes jampacked with new ORM features, granting you access to some new abstractions for more powerful and efficient queries.

#### UNION clause {#orm-union-clause}

Abstractions for the SQL `UNION` clause have been added to `SQLSelect` and `DataQuery`.

To add a `UNION` clause to an `SQLSelect`, call the [`SQLSelect::addUnion()`](api:SilverStripe\ORM\Queries\SQLSelect::addUnion()) method and pass in the `SQLSelect` query you want to combine using a union.

For the second argument, you can leave it blank for a default union (which is functionality equivalent to a distinct union in MySQL) - or you can pass in one of the `SQLSelect::UNION_ALL` or `SQLSelect::UNION_DISTINCT` constants for a `UNION ALL` or `UNION DISTINCT` clause respectively.

```php
$baseQuery = SQLSelect::create()->setFrom($tableName)->addWhere(...);
$anotherQuery = SQLSelect::create()->setFrom($tableName)->addWhere(...);
$baseQuery->addUnion($anotherQuery, SQLSelect::UNION_DISTINCT);
```

To add a `UNION` clause to an `DataQuery`, call the [`DataQuery::union()`](api:SilverStripe\ORM\DataQuery::union()) method and pass in either another `DataQuery` or an `SQLSelect` query you want to combine using a union. The same constants used for `SQLSelect` can be passed in here as well.

```php
$baseQuery = DataQuery::create(MyClass::class)->where(...);
$anotherQuery = DataQuery::create(MyClass::class)->where(...);
$baseQuery->union($anotherQuery, SQLSelect::UNION_ALL);
```

#### Common Table Expressions (CTEs aka the WITH clause) {#orm-with-clause}

Abstractions for Common Table Expressions (aka the SQL `WITH` clause) have been added to `SQLSelect` and `DataQuery`.

Common Table Expressions are a powerful tool both for optimising complex queries, and for creating recursive queries. This functionality is abstracted in the [`SQLSelect::addWith()`](api:SilverStripe\ORM\Queries\SQLSelect::addWith()) and [`DataQuery::with()`](api:SilverStripe\ORM\DataQuery::with()) methods.

Older database servers don't support this functionality, and the core implementation is only valid for MySQL, so if you are using this functionality in an open source module or a project that you can't guarantee the type and version of database being used, you should wrap the query in a condition checking if CTEs are supported. You can do that by calling [`DB::get_conn()->supportsCteQueries()`](api:SilverStripe\ORM\Connect\Database::supportsCteQueries()).

Check out the [SQL Queries](/developer_guides/model/sql_select/#cte) and [Data Model and ORM](/developer_guides/model/data_model_and_orm/#cte) documentation for usage details and examples.

#### RIGHT JOIN clause {#orm-right-join}

Abstractions for `RIGHT JOIN` have been added with the new [`DataList::rightJoin()`](api:SilverStripe\ORM\DataList::rightJoin()), [`DataQuery::rightJoin()`](api:SilverStripe\ORM\DataQuery::rightJoin()), and [`SQLConditionalExpression::addRightJoin()`](api:SilverStripe\ORM\Queries\SQLConditionalExpression::addRightJoin()) methods. The signature for these methods is identical to their `LEFT JOIN` and `INNER JOIN` counterparts.

#### Support for multiple (or no) tables in the FROM clause {#orm-from-clause}

Previously the `SQLConditionalExpression` abstraction couldn't handle multiple table names being passed into its `FROM` clause. This restriction has been removed, so you can now have queries selecting from multiple tables so long as your database supports it. If you were working around that limitation by adding an explicit comma to subsequent tables in the `FROM` clause for your queries, you'll need to remove the comma.

You can also now choose to _not_ have a `FROM` clause in an `SQLSelect` query, which can be useful for setting up simple queries to be used in unit tests.

#### Better support for custom column selections in `DataQuery` {#orm-custom-columns}

When using `DataQuery`, it is possible to use collations and other raw SQL field statements as part of the query's `SELECT` clause. If these have an alias that matches the name of an existing database column, this results in an exception being thrown.

You can choose to allow those conflicts to be resolved via a [`CASE`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/en/case.html) statement. In that scenario, if the value in the database column is null, the value for your custom field statement will be used. This is enabled per query by passing `true` to the new [`DataQuery::setAllowCollidingFieldStatements()`](api:SilverStripe\ORM\DataQuery::setAllowCollidingFieldStatements()) method.

```php
$query = new DataQuery(MyClass::class);
$query->selectField('"my custom title" AS "Title"');
$query->setAllowCollidingFieldStatements(true);
```

### ErrorPage allowed codes configuration

By default, all available error codes are present in the dropdown in the CMS. This can be overwhelming and there are a few (looking at you, 418) that can
be confusing. To that end, you can limit the codes in the dropdown with the config value `allowed_error_codes` like so:

```yml
SilverStripe\ErrorPage\ErrorPage:
  allowed_error_codes:
    - 400
    - 403
    - 404
    - 500
```

### Other new features

## API changes

### silverstripe/framework {#api-silverstripe-framework}

The following legacy subclasses of [`PasswordEncryptor`](api:SilverStripe\Security\PasswordEncryptor) have been deprecated, and will be removed in a future major release. If you are using one of these password encryptors in your projects, we strongly recommend swapping to one that has not been deprecated ([`PasswordEncryptor_Blowfish`](api:SilverStripe\Security\PasswordEncryptor_Blowfish) is the current recommendation, and is the default encryptor for passwords in new installations). Note that changing the password encryptor will also require that all of your members reset their passwords.

- [`PasswordEncryptor_None`](api:SilverStripe\Security\PasswordEncryptor_None)
- [`PasswordEncryptor_LegacyPHPHash`](api:SilverStripe\Security\PasswordEncryptor_LegacyPHPHash)
- [`PasswordEncryptor_MySQLOldPassword`](api:SilverStripe\Security\PasswordEncryptor_MySQLOldPassword)
- [`PasswordEncryptor_MySQLPassword`](api:SilverStripe\Security\PasswordEncryptor_MySQLPassword)

## Bug fixes

This release includes a number of bug fixes to improve a broad range of areas. Check the change logs for full details of these fixes split by module. Thank you to the community members that helped contribute these fixes as part of the release!
