## Features and enhancements

### New ORM features {#new-orm-features}

This release comes jampacked with new ORM features, granting you access to some new abstractions for more powerful and efficient queries.

#### Multi-relational `has_one` relations

Traditionally, if you wanted to have multiple `has_many` relations for the same class, you would have to include a separate `has_one` relation for *each* `has_many` relation.

This release includes a new `has_one` syntax to declare that your `has_one` should be allowed to handle multiple reciprocal `has_many` relations. The syntax for that is as follows:

[hint]
Multi-relational `has_one` relations *must* be polymorphic.
[/hint]

```php
namespace App\Model;

use SilverStripe\ORM\DataObject;
use SilverStripe\ORM\DataObjectSchema;

class MyExample extends DataObject
{
    // ...

    private static array $has_one = [
        'MyMultiRelationalRelation' => [
            // The class here is the class for the has_one - it must be polymorphic.
            'class' => DataObject::class,
            // Setting this to true is what defines this has_one relation as multi-relational
            DataObjectSchema::HAS_ONE_MULTI_RELATIONAL => true,
        ],
    ];
}
```

Multiple `has_many` relations on a single class can point to the above `has_one` relation, and they will be correctly saved and resolved when you get the relation list.

[warning]
This new feature means sometimes the value in the associative `has_one` configuration array will be an array, rather than a class name.
If you are relying on fetching this configuration to find the class names of `has_one` relations, consider using
[`DataObject::hasOne()`](api:SilverStripe\ORM\DataObject::hasOne()) or [`DataObjectSchema::hasOneComponent()`](api:SilverStripe\ORM\DataObjectSchema::hasOneComponent()) instead.
[/warning]

See [multi-relational `has_one` in the relations docs](/developer_guides/model/relations/#multi-relational-has-one) for more details about this relation type.

#### UNION clause {#orm-union-clause}

Abstractions for the SQL `UNION` clause have been added to `SQLSelect` and `DataQuery`.

To add a `UNION` clause to an `SQLSelect`, call the [`SQLSelect::addUnion()`](api:SilverStripe\ORM\Queries\SQLSelect::addUnion()) method and pass in the `SQLSelect` query you want to combine using a union.

For the second argument, you can leave it blank for a default union (which is functionality equivalent to a distinct union in MySQL) - or you can pass in one of the `SQLSelect::UNION_ALL` or `SQLSelect::UNION_DISTINCT` constants for a `UNION ALL` or `UNION DISTINCT` clause respectively.

```php
$baseQuery = SQLSelect::create()->setFrom($tableName)->addWhere(...);
$anotherQuery = SQLSelect::create()->setFrom($tableName)->addWhere(...);
$baseQuery->addUnion($anotherQuery, SQLSelect::UNION_DISTINCT);
```

To add a `UNION` clause to an `DataQuery`, call the [`DataQuery::union()`](api:SilverStripe\ORM\DataQuery::union()) method and pass in either another `DataQuery` or an `SQLSelect` query you want to combine using a union. The same constants used for `SQLSelect` can be passed in here as well.

```php
$baseQuery = DataQuery::create(MyClass::class)->where(...);
$anotherQuery = DataQuery::create(MyClass::class)->where(...);
$baseQuery->union($anotherQuery, SQLSelect::UNION_ALL);
```

#### Common table expressions (CTE aka the WITH clause) {#orm-with-clause}

Abstractions for Common Table Expressions (aka the SQL `WITH` clause) have been added to `SQLSelect` and `DataQuery`.

Common Table Expressions are a powerful tool both for optimising complex queries, and for creating recursive queries. This functionality is abstracted in the [`SQLSelect::addWith()`](api:SilverStripe\ORM\Queries\SQLSelect::addWith()) and [`DataQuery::with()`](api:SilverStripe\ORM\DataQuery::with()) methods.

Older database servers don't support this functionality, and the core implementation is only valid for MySQL, so if you are using this functionality in an open source module or a project that you can't guarantee the type and version of database being used, you should wrap the query in a condition checking if CTEs are supported. You can do that by calling [`DB::get_conn()->supportsCteQueries()`](api:SilverStripe\ORM\Connect\Database::supportsCteQueries()).

Check out the [SQL Queries](/developer_guides/model/sql_select/#cte) and [Data Model and ORM](/developer_guides/model/data_model_and_orm/#cte) documentation for usage details and examples.

#### RIGHT JOIN clause {#orm-right-join}

Abstractions for `RIGHT JOIN` have been added with the new [`DataList::rightJoin()`](api:SilverStripe\ORM\DataList::rightJoin()), [`DataQuery::rightJoin()`](api:SilverStripe\ORM\DataQuery::rightJoin()), and [`SQLConditionalExpression::addRightJoin()`](api:SilverStripe\ORM\Queries\SQLConditionalExpression::addRightJoin()) methods. The signature for these methods is identical to their `LEFT JOIN` and `INNER JOIN` counterparts.

#### Support for multiple (or no) tables in the FROM clause {#orm-from-clause}

Previously the `SQLConditionalExpression` abstraction couldn't handle multiple table names being passed into its `FROM` clause. This restriction has been removed, so you can now have queries selecting from multiple tables so long as your database supports it. If you were working around that limitation by adding an explicit comma to subsequent tables in the `FROM` clause for your queries, you'll need to remove the comma.

You can also now choose to *not* have a `FROM` clause in an `SQLSelect` query, which can be useful for setting up simple queries to be used in unit tests.

#### Better support for custom column selections in `DataQuery` {#orm-custom-columns}

When using `DataQuery`, it is possible to use collations and other raw SQL field statements as part of the query's `SELECT` clause. If these have an alias that matches the name of an existing database column, this results in an exception being thrown.

You can choose to allow those conflicts to be resolved via a [`CASE`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/en/case.html) statement. In that scenario, if the value in the database column is null, the value for your custom field statement will be used. This is enabled per query by passing `true` to the new [`DataQuery::setAllowCollidingFieldStatements()`](api:SilverStripe\ORM\DataQuery::setAllowCollidingFieldStatements()) method.

```php
$query = new DataQuery(MyClass::class);
$query->selectField('"my custom title" AS "Title"');
$query->setAllowCollidingFieldStatements(true);
```

### GridField components now work with arbitrary data {#gridfield-arbitrary-data}

It has historically been difficult to use a `GridField` to display data that isn't represented by `DataObject` records - and even more difficult to edit that data.

We have removed several barriers to using the `GridField` to display arbitrary data. Descriptive exceptions will be thrown when specific information cannot be dynamically identified, such as which columns to display and what form fields to use when viewing or editing data. Note that these new exceptions do not break backwards compatibility. Any scenario that will throw an exception now would have already done so - but the old exception would not have been sufficiently descriptive to quickly understand what changes are required to get a functioning `GridField`.

This applies to all `GridFieldComponent` classes in `silverstripe/framework` except for [`GridFieldAddExistingAutocompleter`](api:SilverStripe\Forms\GridField\GridFieldAddExistingAutocompleter) and [`GridFieldLevelup`](api:SilverStripe\Forms\GridField\GridFieldLevelup), which both explicitly require the model class for the associated `GridField` to be a subclass of `DataObject`.

See [using `GridField` with arbitrary data](/developer_guides/forms/using_gridfield_with_arbitrary_data/) for more information.

### ErrorPage allowed codes configuration

By default, all available error codes are present in the dropdown in the CMS. This can be overwhelming and there are a few (looking at you, 418) that can
be confusing. To that end, you can limit the codes in the dropdown with the config value `allowed_error_codes` like so:

```yml
SilverStripe\ErrorPage\ErrorPage:
  allowed_error_codes:
    - 400
    - 403
    - 404
    - 500
```

### Create random passwords for new users

If a new user is created in the security section of the CMS with an empty password, then a strong random password will now be automatically assigned to the user which will not be visible to the person creating the user. The user will need to click the "I've forgotten my password" link in order to receive a password reset email so they can then enter a new password.

This is a behavioural change from the change introduced in Silverstripe CMS 5.1 where blank passwords were disallowed when creating a new user. This change in 5.1 meant the administrator setting up the user could know what the users password was until the user changed it. Prior to 5.1, blank passwords were allowed though users were unable to log in using them when the default Silverstripe member authenticator was used, thus forcing the user to reset their password.

This only applies to users created through the security section of the CMS. Users created programatically with an empty password will not have a random password automatically assigned to them. This is the current behaviour and is often used for non-production purposes such as unit-testing.

### Buttons to select all files and deselect all files {#bulk-action-buttons}

The files section of the CMS now has buttons to select and deselect all files and folders currently on the screen, which is useful when you want to perform bulk operations. These buttons show at the bottom of the screen in the bulk actions toolbar. The deselect all button also shows the number of currently selected items. As these buttons are on the bulk actions toolbar they are only visible if at least one item has been selected.

### New searchable dropdown fields {#searchable-dropdown-field}

A pair of new dropdown form fields have been added which are particularly useful for dropdowns with a large number of options.

[`SearchableDropdownField`](api:SilverStripe\Forms\SearchableDropdownField) is similar to [`DropdownField`](api:SilverStripe\Forms\DropdownField) which allows selecting a single option, and [`SearchableMultiDropdownField`](api:SilverStripe\Forms\SearchableMultiDropdownField) is similar to [`ListboxField`](api:SilverStripe\Forms\ListboxField) which allows selecting multiple options.

Both of these fields include a `setIsLazyLoaded()` method which will load a limited number of options at a time using an AJAX request matching what a user has typed in. There are quite a few options to customise these, including optionally using `SearchContext` to power the lazy-loaded search functionality. We encourage you to look at the API documentation for these new classes to see what you can do with them.

Note that these are both powered by react components, and are only intended to be used within the CMS. If you want to use them on the front-end of your project you will need to provide your own templates and JavaScript implementation for them.

#### Auto scaffolding of `has_one` relations

A `SearchableDropdownField` will now be used when automatically scaffolding `has_one` relations on a form in the CMS. Previously a `DropdownField` was used, and when there were over 100 items a [`NumericField`](api:SilverStripe\Forms\NumericField) was used which was not user friendly.

Previously the [`DBForeignKey.dropdown_field_threshold`](api:SilverStripe\ORM\FieldType\DBForeignKey->dropdown_field_threshold) config property was used as the threshold of the number of options to decide when to switch between auto-scaffolding a `DropdownField` and a `NumericField`. This configuration property is now used as the threshold of the number of options to decide when to start using lazy-loading for the `SearchableDropdownField`.

### More nuanced permissions for `/dev/*` routes {#dev-route-permissions}

Previously, all `/dev/*` routes registered with [`DevelopmentAdmin`](api:SilverStripe\Dev\DevelopmentAdmin) (for example `/dev/tasks/MyBuildTask`) could only be access by administrator users, and this couldn't be configured.

Now, all of the controllers which handle these routes that come packaged in a core or supported module have a new `init_permissions` configuration property (e.g. [`TaskRunner.init_permissions`](api:SilverStripe\Dev\TaskRunner->init_permissions)). This new configuration can be used to grant non-administrative users access to these routes.

You can also now optionally implement a `canView()` method on your `BuildTask` implementations to restrict accessed for specific tasks even further. This means you can grant access to *some* tasks to specific users or groups without granting access to *all* tasks.

### New exception in react forms {#react-forms-exception}

A [`LogicException`](https://www.php.net/manual/en/class.logicexception.php) is now thrown by [`FormSchema::getSchema()`](api:SilverStripe\Forms\Schema::getSchema()) if a react component was not found for a field type.

[warning]
If your project or a module you're using is currently trying to include a field which doesn't have a react component into a react-rendered form, it will have been silently failing. The form will have been rendering everything except for the field(s) which have no react component.

This will now fail by throwing an exception, which means your form won't render at all until you remove or replace the field(s).
[/warning]

### Other new features

- A new [`SiteTree.hide_pagetypes`](api:SilverStripe\CMS\Model\SiteTree->hide_pagetypes) configuration property has been added. Unlike [`SiteTree.hide_ancestor`](api:SilverStripe\CMS\Model\SiteTree->hide_ancestor) (which has [now been deprecated](#api-silverstripe-cms)), this is an array. This allows you to define all page types that should be hidden in a single configuration property in your YAML configuration.
- The [`silverstripe/mfa module`](https://github.com/silverstripe/silverstripe-mfa) now allows you to specify which groups can register MFA for their account.

## API changes

### `silverstripe/framework` {#api-silverstripe-framework}

The following legacy subclasses of [`PasswordEncryptor`](api:SilverStripe\Security\PasswordEncryptor) have been deprecated, and will be removed in a future major release. If you are using one of these password encryptors in your projects, we strongly recommend swapping to one that has not been deprecated ([`PasswordEncryptor_Blowfish`](api:SilverStripe\Security\PasswordEncryptor_Blowfish) is the current recommendation, and is the default encryptor for passwords in new installations). Note that changing the password encryptor will also require that all of your members reset their passwords.

- [`PasswordEncryptor_None`](api:SilverStripe\Security\PasswordEncryptor_None)
- [`PasswordEncryptor_LegacyPHPHash`](api:SilverStripe\Security\PasswordEncryptor_LegacyPHPHash)
- [`PasswordEncryptor_MySQLOldPassword`](api:SilverStripe\Security\PasswordEncryptor_MySQLOldPassword)
- [`PasswordEncryptor_MySQLPassword`](api:SilverStripe\Security\PasswordEncryptor_MySQLPassword)

### `silverstripe/cms` {#api-silverstripe-cms}

The [`SiteTree.hide_ancestor`](api:SilverStripe\CMS\Model\SiteTree->hide_ancestor) configuration property has been deprecated. Use [`SiteTree.hide_pagetypes`](api:SilverStripe\CMS\Model\SiteTree->hide_pagetypes) instead.

### `silverstripe/versioned` {#api-silverstripe-versioned}

The `$having` parameter in the [`Versioned::Versions()`](api:SilverStripe\Versioned\Versioned::Versions()) method has been deprecated. This parameter was never used, and has been removed from the method signature.

## Bug fixes
