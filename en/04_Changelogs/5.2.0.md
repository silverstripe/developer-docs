## Features and enhancements

### Other new features

## API changes

### silverstripe/framework

The following legacy subclasses of [`PasswordEncryptor`](api:SilverStripe\Security\PasswordEncryptor) have been deprecated, and will be removed in a future major release. If you are using one of these password encryptors in your projects, we strongly recommend swapping to one that has not been deprecated ([`PasswordEncryptor_Blowfish`](api:SilverStripe\Security\PasswordEncryptor_Blowfish) is the current recommendation, and is the default encryptor for passwords in new installations). Note that changing the password encryptor will also require that all of your members reset their passwords.

- [`PasswordEncryptor_None`](api:SilverStripe\Security\PasswordEncryptor_None)
- [`PasswordEncryptor_LegacyPHPHash`](api:SilverStripe\Security\PasswordEncryptor_LegacyPHPHash)
- [`PasswordEncryptor_MySQLOldPassword`](api:SilverStripe\Security\PasswordEncryptor_MySQLOldPassword)
- [`PasswordEncryptor_MySQLPassword`](api:SilverStripe\Security\PasswordEncryptor_MySQLPassword)
