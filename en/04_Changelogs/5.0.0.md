### General changes {#api-general}

- [SecurityAdmin](api:SilverStripe\Admin\SecurityAdmin) now extends [ModelAdmin](api:SilverStripe\Admin\ModelAdmin) instead of [LeftAndMain](api:SilverStripe\Admin\LeftAndMain) so that it can make use of standard API. This was done to remove duplicate code.
  - `MemberImportForm.php` has been removed
  - `GroupImportForm.php` has been removed
  - Previous extension hook implementations of `SecurityAdmin::updateEditForm($form)` should still work as the extension hook is called in `ModelAdmin::getEditForm()`
  - The Users, Groups and Roles tabs now no longer share the /admin/security path and instead have their own dedicated paths e.g. /admin/security/users
- `isDev` and `isTest` querystring arguments have been removed due to security concerns (see [ss-2018-005](https://www.silverstripe.org/download/security-releases/ss-2018-005/)).
- The default value for the `RESOURCES_DIR` const has been changed to to "_resources"
  - The `Library::DEFAULT_RESOURCES_DIR` const in `silverstripe/vendor-plugin` has been changed to match.
  - This can still be customised using `extra.resources-dir` in your composer.json file ([see relevant docs](/developer_guides/templates/requirements/#configuring-your-project-exposed-folders))
  - If your composer.json file has its `extra.resources-dir` key set to `_resources`, you can remove that now.
  - If your composer.json file already does not have an `extra.resources-dir` key and you want to keep your resources in the `resources` directory, you can set `extra.resources-dir` to "resources".
  - If your composer.json file already does not have an `extra.resources-dir` key and you want to use the new default `_resources` directory, you may need to check that your code and templates don't assume the directory name for those resources. In your templates it is preferred to [use `$resourePath()` or `$resourceURL()`](/developer_guides/templates/requirements/#direct-resource-urls) to get paths for resources.
- `SilverStripe\Dev\FunctionalTest` is now abstract.
- `SilverStripe\Dev\MigrationTask` is now abstract.
- `SilverStripe\Dev\SapphireTest` is now abstract.
- `SilverStripe\Core\Extensible::invokeWithExtensions()` and `SilverStripe\Core\Extensible::extend()` now use the splat operator instead of having a concrete number of possible arguments.
- The constructor for `SilverStripe\Versioned\Versioned` now explicitly only accepts mode as a single argument.
- The following classes have been moved from `silverstripe/cms` to `silverstripe/admin` and renamed:
  - `SilverStripe\CMS\Controllers\SilverStripeNavigator` is now in silverstripe/admin as `SilverStripe\Admin\Navigator\SilverStripeNavigator`
  - `SilverStripe\CMS\Controllers\SilverStripeNavigatorItem` is now in silverstripe/admin as `SilverStripe\Admin\Navigator\SilverStripeNavigatorItem`
  - `SilverStripe\CMS\Controllers\SilverStripeNavigatorItem_Unversioned` is now in silverstripe/admin as `SilverStripe\Admin\Navigator\SilverStripeNavigatorItem_Unversioned`
- The following classes have been moved from `silverstripe/cms` to `silverstripe/versioned-admin` and renamed:
  - `SilverStripe\CMS\Controllers\SilverStripeNavigatorItem_ArchiveLink` is now in silverstripe/versioned as `SilverStripe\VersionedAdmin\Navigator\SilverStripeNavigatorItem_ArchiveLink`
  - `SilverStripe\CMS\Controllers\SilverStripeNavigatorItem_LiveLink` is now in silverstripe/versioned as `SilverStripe\VersionedAdmin\Navigator\SilverStripeNavigatorItem_LiveLink`
  - `SilverStripe\CMS\Controllers\SilverStripeNavigatorItem_StageLink` is now in silverstripe/versioned as `SilverStripe\VersionedAdmin\Navigator\SilverStripeNavigatorItem_StageLink`
- Various internal controller methods have been updated to now consistently return an `SilverStripe\Control\HTTPResponse` object, rather than an undeclared `mixed` return type. These updates do not affect custom controller action methods which can still have an undeclared mixed return type.
  - In particular, the following will need to be updated if they have been subclassed and overloaded in custom code:
    - `SilverStripe\Admin\LeftAndMain::index()`
    - `SilverStripe\Admin\CMSBatchAction::run()`
- Removed the `HTMLValue` injection "shorthand", use the fully qualified `SilverStripe\View\Parsers\HTMLValue` instead.
- The native PHP interfaces [`ArrayAccess`](https://www.php.net/manual/en/class.arrayaccess.php), [`IteratorAggregate`](https://www.php.net/IteratorAggregate), [`Countable`](https://www.php.net/manual/en/class.countable.php), [`SessionHandlerInterface`](https://www.php.net/manual/en/class.sessionhandlerinterface.php) and [`Iterator`](https://www.php.net/manual/en/class.iterator.php) are now strongly typed. All Silverstripe CMS classes implementing those interfaces have been updated to be strongly typed and all `#[\ReturnTypeWillChange]` annotations have been removed. This includes:
  - `SilverStripe\Control\HTTPRequest`
  - `SilverStripe\Dev\BulkLoader_Result`
  - `SilverStripe\ORM\ArrayList`
  - `SilverStripe\ORM\MySQLQuery\Connect\MySQLQuery`
  - `SilverStripe\ORM\MySQLQuery\Connect\MySQLStatement`
  - `SilverStripe\ORM\MySQLQuery\Connect\Query`
  - `SilverStripe\ORM\DataList`
  - `SilverStripe\ORM\ListDecorator`
  - `SilverStripe\ORM\Map`
  - `SilverStripe\ORM\PaginatedList`
  - `SilverStripe\ORM\UnsavedRelationList`
  - `SilverStripe\View\ViewableData`
  - `SilverStripe\Admin\CMSMenu`
  - `SilverStripe\Assets\Storage\DefaultAssetNameGenerator`
  - `SilverStripe\HybridSessions\HybridSession`
  - `SilverStripe\HybridSessions\Store\CookieStore`
  - `SilverStripe\HybridSessions\Store\DatabaseStore`
  - `SilverStripe\LDAP\Iterators\LDAPIterator`
  - `SilverStripe\FullTextSearch\Utils\CombinationsArrayIterator`
  - `SilverStripe\FullTextSearch\Utils\MultipleArrayIterator`


### Email {#api-email}

- Email was sent in CMS 4 using [SwiftMailer](https://swiftmailer.symfony.com/docs/introduction.html), which has since [gone End Of Life](https://symfony.com/blog/the-end-of-swiftmailer). In CMS 5 this has been replaced with [symfony/mailer](https://symfony.com/doc/current/mailer.html). `symfony/mailer` is the currently maintained email package from Symfony. It's a more flexible email system that allows easier integration with third-party email providers.
- In CMS 4 the `SilverStripe\Control\Email\Email` class subclassed `SilverStripe\View\ViewableData`. In CMS 5 it now subclasses `Symfony\Component\Mime\Email`.
- `MailTransport`, which used the php native `mail()` function, is no longer officially supported in CMS 5. This is because [Symfony considers `mail()` to be insecure](https://github.com/swiftmailer/swiftmailer/issues/866#issuecomment-289291228).
- If your site has a custom email configuration e.g. SMTP configuration, this will need to be updated, as the configuration has changed from Silverstripe yml to a much more flexible and standardised [DSN string](https://symfony.com/doc/current/mailer.html#transport-setup). See [the email documentation](/developer_guides/email/) for more details. The configuration for email has changed completely - please read the updated documentation carefully.
- The following return types where changed on the following methods in [Email](api:SilverStripe\Control\Email\Email)
  - Used to return a string, now returns an nullable [Address](https://symfony.com/doc/current/mailer.html#email-addresses) object
    - `getReturnPath()`
    - `getSender()`
  - Used to return an array of strings, now returns an array of `Address` objects
    - `getFrom()`
    - `getTo()`
    - `getBCC()` - note - changed casing to `getBcc()`
    - `getCC()` - note - changed casing to `getCc()`
  - Used to return `bool`, now return `void`:
    - `send()`
    - `sendPlain()`
  - Various other methods have added strong typing to parameter and return types. Also some parameter names have changed.

### ORM {#api-orm}

- [DataList::sort()](api:SilverStripe\ORM\DataList) No longer accepts raw SQL. A new method `DataList::orderBy()` has been created which accepts raw SQL, though it's recommended to continue using `DataList::sort()` if possible to reduce the chance of SQL injection vulnerabilities.
- Passing `null` to `DataList::sort()` i.e. `sort(null)` will now clear any existing sort values on a DataList. Passing an empty string i.e. `sort('')` or array i.e. `sort([])` will now cause an `InvalidArgumentException` to be thrown.
- Prior to 5.0.0, when using `SQLSelect::setFrom()` or `SQLSelect::create('*', $from)` to set table or subselect definitions,
their aliases (applied by setting a string key for the array) were being ignored. This bug has been fixed - if you were working around this by manually setting the alias e.g. in a join, you can remove those workarounds now.
- [Query](api:SilverStripe\ORM\Connect\Query) now implements `IteratorAggregate` instead of `Iterator`. This means `seek()` and other iterator methods are no longer available on this class and its subclasses. Use `getIterator()` instead.
- [DataList](SilverStripe\ORM\DataList), its subclasses, [Map](api:SilverStripe\ORM\Map), and [ArrayList](SilverStripe\ORM\ArrayList) all now return generators from `getIterator()`. This reduces memory usage when looping over large result sets. As a result of this, `getGenerator()` has been removed as it is no longer needed. Note that `chunkedFetch()` has not been removed, as it may still be useful for very large result sets to fetch results in smaller chunks at a time.

### Templates

- `<% loop %>` and `<% with %>` now only ever result in one new scope level. See [Template Syntax](/developer_guides/templates/syntax#up) for more details.

  For example `<% loop $Pages.Limit(5) %>{$Up.Up.Title}<% end_loop %>` previously would go up once to the `$Pages` scope (out of the `$Pages.limit(5)` scope), then up a second time to the parent scope. Now there is only the parent scope and the `$Pages.limit(5)` scope - there is no implied `$Pages` scope.

  You may need to do a search for `$Up.Up` in your templates to resolve situations where you have worked around this - with the example above, you would need to rewrite it to `$Up.Title` (removing the second `Up`).

- Numeric, boolean and null values passed to methods in templates will now preserve their type, rather than always being cast to strings. E.g. `$Foo(true)` would previously pass a string argument `'true'` to the `Foo()` method, but will now pass an actual boolean.

  You may need to check for situations where you were working around this limitation, such as checking in php code for `$param === 'false'` if you were passing `false` into some method from a template.

## Dependency changes

### General changes {#dep-general}

- `swiftmailer/swiftmailer` has been removed and replaced with `symfony/mailer`
- Various Symfony dependencies have been upgraded from 4.x to 6.x. A small number of code changes were made in silverstripe/framework to work with the symfony 6.x dependencies.
- silverstripe/graphql v3 is no longer supported. It is recommended that you ensure you are using graphl v4 in your Silverstripe CMS 4 project before upgrading to Silverstripe CMS 5. There is [documentation for the upgrade process here](https://docs.silverstripe.org/en/4/upgrading/upgrading_to_graphql_4/).
- PHPUnit 5.7 is no longer supported. It is recommended that you ensure your tests are running with PHPUnit 9 in your Silverstripe CMS 4 project before upgrading to Silverstripe CMS 5. There is [documentation for the upgrade process here](https://docs.silverstripe.org/en/4/upgrading/phpunit9/).
- `masterminds/html5` is now used to parse HTML content instead of `DomDocument::loadHTML()`. This may cause slight changes in rendered content if the content being saved contains invalid HTML. The optional module `silverstripe/html5` is no longer required for rendering HTML 5 content.

### TinyMCE upgraded from 4 to 6 {#tinymce6}

TinyMCE has been upgraded up two major versions from 4 to 6. The API for [HTMLEditorConfig](api:SilverStripe\Forms\HTMLEditor\HTMLEditorConfig) and [TinyMCEConfig](api:SilverStripe\Forms\HTMLEditor\TinyMCEConfig) haven't changed at all, but there have been some changes to plugins and options which may affect your projects. Here are some notable changes:

- The `styleselect` option for selecting a css style has changed to `styles`
- The `spellchecker` plugin is now a premium "[Spell Checker Pro](https://www.tiny.cloud/docs/tinymce/6/introduction-to-tiny-spellchecker/)" plugin through TinyMCE cloud (though the `browser_spellcheck` options still works and is enabled by default)
- The "paste from Microsoft Word" functionality is now part of a premium "[PowerPaste](https://www.tiny.cloud/docs/tinymce/6/introduction-to-powerpaste/)" plugin through TinyMCE cloud
  - There is an [open call for maintainers](https://github.com/tinymce/tinymce/discussions/7487) for converting the old functionality into a new open source plugin
- The UI API has changed, which will affect any custom plugins you may be using. Notably:
  - most `addX()` functions have been moved from `editor` to `editor.ui.registry` - e.g. `editor.addButton()` is now `editor.ui.registry.addButton()`
  - `onclick` functions on buttons have been changed to `onAction`.

There were a lot more changes than just those, so you may want to also check out the following resources:

- [Docs for upgrading from 4 to 5](https://www.tiny.cloud/docs/migration-from-4x/)

## Front-end build stack upgrades {#front-end}

[info]
"Front-end" in this section refers to the javascript and css in the CMS. It doesn't have any impact on your website's public-facing front-end.
[/info]

We've upgraded the front-end build stack for the CMS, along with most of the javascript dependencies.

### Webpack config

The [@silverstripe/webpack-config](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@silverstripe/webpack-config) and [@silverstripe/eslint-config](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@silverstripe/eslint-config) NPM libraries, along with the build stack for all supported modules, has been updated to be compatible with node 18 and webpack 5. This will only impact you if your module or project uses one or both of those NPM packages - you will need to make sure you update your own dependencies to be compatible with them, along with the dependencies listed below if you use them.

With this comes a change to the API for `@silverstripe/webpack-config`. There is a new (optional) abstracted API for declaring the webpack config for transpiling the javascript and css for your CMS customisations, which has been documented extensively in the readme for that library.

You can continue to use the old API if you want to, but you will need to account for the following breaking changes:

- The `UglifyJsPlugin` is no longer used to remove comments from transpiled code. Refer to the `optimisation` config in [the abstracted JavascriptWebpackConfig class](https://github.com/silverstripe/webpack-config/blob/2/configMeta/javascriptWebpackConfig.js) instead.
- `script-loader`, `file-loader`, and `url-loader` have all been replaced with the relevant [webpack assets](https://webpack.js.org/guides/asset-modules/) configuration.
- `ExtractTextPlugin` and its associated configuration has been replaced with `MiniCssExtractPlugin`.
- Supported browser configuration has been replaced with setting an appropriate [browserslist](https://browsersl.ist) configuration in your `package.json` file.

### Updated javascript dependencies

The following javascript dependencies (which are used in the CMS, and may impact your customisations) have been updated to new major versions, or replaced:

### Common upgrade patterns

While upgrading core modules, there were a few common patterns we found that might be useful for you. Those are listed here for your convenience.

#### `ReactDOM.render()` replaced with `ReactDOM.createRoot().render()`

If you are injecting a React component in a section of the CMS that uses entwine, you likely have something like this:

```js
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';

$('.grid-field').entwine({
  onmatch() {
    ReactDOM.render(<MyComponent />, this[0]);
  },

  onunmatch() {
    const container = this[0];
    if (container) {
      ReactDOM.unmountComponentAtNode(container);
    }
  },
});
```

Instead of using `ReactDOM.render()`, you should now call `ReactDOM.createRoot().render()` - but if you try to use `createRoot()` multiple times on the same element, react will complain, so you'll want to keep a reference to the root you made the first time. The above example turns into this:

```js
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';

$('.grid-field').entwine({
  ReactRoot: null,

  onmatch() {
    let root = this.getReactRoot();
    if (!root) {
      root = ReactDOM.createRoot(this[0]);
    }
    root.render(<MyComponent />);
    this.setReactRoot(root);
  },

  onunmatch() {
    const root = this.getReactRoot();
    if (root) {
      root.unmount();
      this.setReactRoot(null);
    }
  },
});
```

#### React route paths are now relative to their parent routes

The update to `react-router` has changed the paths for routes in react-only sections of the CMS (such as /admin/assets) to be relative to the parent routes. If you have a custom react CMS section, you'll need to make sure you're using the relative path. This is included as `reactRoutePath` in the array returned by `LeftAndMain::getClientConfig()` by default, but you may need to double check your custom admin section is returning the correct value.

Then, in your javascript implementation where you are adding your route to the `ReactRouteRegister`, simple change your route's path from using the `url` key to use the new `reactRoutePath` key.

```diff
  import ConfigHelpers from 'lib/Config';
  import reactRouteRegister from 'lib/ReactRouteRegister';
  import MyAdmin from './MyAdmin';

  document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', () => {
      const sectionConfig = ConfigHelpers.getSection('MyAdmin');
      reactRouteRegister.add({
-         path: sectionConfig.url,
+         path: sectionConfig.reactRoutePath,
          component: MyAdminComponent,
      });
  });
```

#### `react-router` no longer has a `withRouter` HOC

In the old version of react-router, the `withRouter` Higher Order Component could be used to wrap your component which needs access to the router and its functionality.

This has been removed. The ideal way to upgrade will be to rewrite your components to work with the new API as per the upgrade guide referenced in the table above.

If you don't have time or resources to rewrite your components, we do have a temporary solution for you - but bear in mind that this is just kicking the can down the road. You _will_ have to upgrade to use the new react-router API eventually.

Silverstripe CMS 5 includes a replacement `withRouter` Higher Order Component that you can use until you have the resources necessary to upgrade properly. It passes different props than the old one did, so you will still need to make some changes. For example:

```js
import React, { Component } from 'react';
import PropTypes from 'prop-types';
import { withRouter } from 'react-router-dom';

class MyAdmin extends Component {
  // Your implementation here
}

MyAdmin.propTypes = {
  location: PropTypes.shape({
    pathname: PropTypes.string,
    query: PropTypes.object,
    search: PropTypes.string,
  }),
  match: PropTypes.shape({
    params: PropTypes.shape({
      view: PropTypes.string,
      id: PropTypes.number,
    }),
  }),
  history: PropTypes.object,
};

export default withRouter(MyAdmin);
```

The above expects the `match` and `history` props from the `withRouter` HOC. These are no longer passed. What's more, you don't have to declare your own proptypes, we've exported that for you. The above now becomes this:

```js
import React, { Component } from 'react';
import withRouter, { routerPropTypes } from 'lib/withRouter';

class MyAdmin extends Component {
  // Your implementation here
}

MyAdmin.propTypes = {
  router: routerPropTypes,
};

export default withRouter(MyAdmin);
```

The new props that our `withRouter` HOC passes in is a single prop called `router` which has the following `PropTypes` definition:

```js
PropTypes.shape({
  location: PropTypes.shape({
    pathname: PropTypes.string,
    query: PropTypes.object,
    search: PropTypes.string,
  }),
  navigate: PropTypes.func,
  params: PropTypes.object,
})
```

`router.params` is a one-to-one replacement for the old `match.params`, and `router.location` is a one-to-one replacement for the old `location` prop.

Refer to the upgrade guide from the table above to learn how to replace the old `history` prop with the new `router.navigate` prop.

### Breaking changes in _our_ javascript components or API {#js-api}

For the most part we were able to retain our existing API and not make any drastic changes to our react components through upgrading our dependencies, but there was one notable exception.

To conform with the API changes in the new version of `react-select`, the `TreeDropdownField` component has changed considerably, and the `TreeDropdownFieldMenu` component has been removed entirely.

If you were customising the `TreeDropdownField` React component at all or injecting a custom version of `TreeDropdownFieldMenu`, you will want to take a look at the source code for the `TreeDropdownField` component and maybe have a look at the upgrade guides for `react-select` referenced in the table above to see what changes you need to make.

Some of the css classes related to `TreeDropdownField` have also changed, as a result of the upgrade to `react-select`.

## Other breaking changes

### URLs generated by Silverstripe CMS don't include a trailing slash by default {#trailing-slash}

The URLs generated by Silverstripe CMS have previously been inconsistent as to whether a trailing slash is included or not. This lead to the creation of [at least one module](https://github.com/axllent/silverstripe-trailing-slash) which normalises the trailing slash at the end of URLs.

By default, all URLs created by Silverstripe will now _not_ end with a slash. You can configure this to instead explicitly add a trailing slash to all URLs with the following YML configuration:

```yml
SilverStripe\Control\Controller:
    add_trailing_slash: true
```

[warning]
Because this can be controlled with configuration, it is best practice to avoid explicitly expecting a trailing slash to either be present or be omitted.

In PHP you can use methods like [Controller::join_links()](api:SilverStripe\Control\Controller::join_links()) or [Controller::normaliseTrailingSlash()](api:SilverStripe\Control\Controller::normaliseTrailingSlash()). In JavaScript in your CMS customisations, we recommend using using the `joinUrlPaths()` utility function `silverstripe/admin` which you can access with `import { joinUrlPaths } from 'lib/urls;` if your project uses [@silverstripe/webpack-config](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@silverstripe/webpack-config). In your templates, you should use appropriate methods from your controller or model such as [SiteTree::Link()](api:SilverStripe\CMS\Model\SiteTree::Link()) which uses `Controller::join_links()` under the hood.
[/warning]

The [CanonicalURLMiddleware](api:SilverStripe\Control\Middleware\CanonicalURLMiddleware) will also, by default, redirect traffic to include or omit the trailing slash according to the above configuration. By default, this means that traffic directed to `/about-us/` will be redirected to `/about-us`. You can disable this behaviour with the following YML configuration:

```yml
SilverStripe\Core\Injector\Injector:
  SilverStripe\Control\Middleware\CanonicalURLMiddleware:
    properties:
      enforceTrailingSlashConfig: false
```

[info]
Redirects will not be performed for any route starting with `admin/` or `dev/` by default. You can configure this, as well as exclude specific user agents from being redirected, with the following YML configuration:

```yml
SilverStripe\Core\Injector\Injector:
  SilverStripe\Control\Middleware\CanonicalURLMiddleware:
    properties:
      enforceTrailingSlashConfigIgnorePaths:
        - 'my-ajax-controller/'
      enforceTrailingSlashConfigIgnoreUserAgents:
        - 'my-dev-user-agent'
```

[/info]

### CWP Agency Extensions

The [cwp/agency-extensions](https://github.com/silverstripe/cwp-agencyextensions) module used to provide a Font Awesome v4 plugin for TinyMCE 4. This plugin is not compatible with TinyMCE 6 and we couldn't see an appropriate alternative plugin to use instead. The fact that such a replacement doesn't seem to exist in the wild suggests to us that the use-case is very narrow, so we have opted to remove this plugin without replacing it.

If your project has no content which used the Font Awesome plugin provided by this module, you don't need to make any changes - though you can remove the `CWP_AGENCY_DISABLE_FONTAWESOME_PLUGIN` environment variable from your `.env` file if it was set.

If your project does have some content which contains Font Awesome icons from that plugin, you will need to set `CWP_AGENCY_ENABLE_FONTAWESOME_STYLES` to true in your environment variables. This will allow you to see the existing icons in the TinyMCE field in the CMS, as well as ensuring that they will not be removed when you save content. The front-end will not be impacted, as you already had to inject an appropriate stylesheet into the front-end for the icons to appear there.

If you cannot set environment variables in your project, you can set the following configuration manually in your project:

**_config.php**
```php
use SilverStripe\Forms\HTMLEditor\TinyMCEConfig;

TinyMCEConfig::get('cwp')->setOption(
    'extended_valid_elements',
    $cwpEditor->getOption('extended_valid_elements')
    . ',span[class|align|style|aria-hidden]'
);
```

**_config/font-awesome.yml**
```yml
SilverStripe\Forms\HTMLEditor\TinyMCEConfig:
  editor_css:
    - "https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/font-awesome/4.7.0/css/font-awesome.min.css"
```

If you need the ability to add icons in your content, a suitable alternative may be the [emoticons plugin for TinyMCE 6](https://www.tiny.cloud/docs/plugins/opensource/emoticons/). You can compare the icons provided by that plugin with the [icons in Font Awesome v4](https://fontawesome.com/v4/icons/) to see if it would be a suitable replacement for your project.

## Features and enhancements {#features-and-enhancements}

### Extension changes
[Extension](api:SilverStripe\Core\Extension) classes don't expose `protected` methods, but they _can_ be used for extension hooks. This reduces the surface of methods exposed from your extensions into `Extensible` classes. For example, you might have a `protected function updateCMSFields()` method which will be called after writing some `DataObject` - but because this method is `protected`, it _cannot_ be accessed directly from the `DataObject` instances. You can however still expose some method from the `Extension` by making it `public` - and that method _can_ be accessed directly from the `DataObject` instances.

When invoking an extension hook (e.g. via `extend()`), methods prefixed with "extend" will take precendence. i.e. if an `Extension` class has a `onAfterWrite()` method and an `extendOnAfterWrite()` method and I call `$this->extend('onAfterWrite')` - the `extendOnAfterWrite()` method on that `Extension` will be called, and `onAfterWrite()` will not.  
This empowers advanced `Extension` functionality such as [Versioned::canPublish()](api:SilverStripe\Versioned\Versioned::canPublish()) which invokes `$owner->extendedCan('canPublish')` but doesn't result in a cycle, because the same class also implements [extendCanPublish()](api:SilverStripe\Versioned\Versioned::extendCanPublish()).

### Other new features {#other-features}

- [DataObject::get_one()][api:SilverStripe\ORM\DataObject::get_one()] can now be called directly from subclasses of `DataObject` without passing in a class as the first argument (e.g. `SiteTree::get_one(filter: ['Title:startsWith' => 'About'])`).
- The elemental [TopPage DataExtension](api:DNADesign\Elemental\TopPage\DataExtension) is applied to [BaseElement](api:DNADesign\Elemental\Models\BaseElement) and [ElementalArea](api:DNADesign\Elemental\Models\ElementalArea) by default, and the corresponding [SiteTreeExtension](api:DNADesign\Elemental\TopPage\SiteTreeExtension) is applied to [SiteTree](api:SilverStripe\CMS\Model\SiteTree) by default. This allows you to use `$TopPage` in your elemental block templates as a more performant alternative to `$Page` when referring to the page the element belongs to.
- Void HTML elements such as `<img>` are no longer rendered as self-closing tags e.g. `<img src="foo" alt="bar">` is now rendered, previously `<img src="foo" alt="bar" />` was rendered.

## Bugfixes {#bugfixes}

- If a page which is a child of a root-level page gets archived, and then its former parent is removed, it can only be restored if `can_be_root` for that page's class is true.

This release includes a number of bug fixes to improve a broad range of areas. Check the change logs for full details of these fixes split by module. Thank you to the community members that helped contribute these fixes as part of the release!

## Environment variable changes

- `SS_MANIFESTCACHE` can no longer use the now removed symfony/cache 4.x "Simple" cache classes e.g. `Symfony\Component\Cache\Simple\PhpFilesCache`. Instead use the corresponding "Adapter" class e.g. `Symfony\Component\Cache\Adapter\PhpFilesAdapter`.
- `APP_SMTP_USERNAME` and `APP_SMTP_PASSWORD` have been removed. Use a `MAILER_DSN` environment variable instead to configure SMTP email (see [the email documentation](/developer_guides/email/) for more details).
