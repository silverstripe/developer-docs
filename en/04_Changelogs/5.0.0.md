## API changes

This is a major release and as a result there are a number of breaking API changes. For a full list of these see [upgrading your project](/upgrading/upgrading_your_project). Some specific details about a few of them are below.

- Removed deprecated class `SilverStripe\VersionedAdmin\Controllers\HistoryControllerFactory`

### General changes {#api-general}

- `isDev` and `isTest` querystring arguments have been removed due to security concerns (see [ss-2018-005](https://www.silverstripe.org/download/security-releases/ss-2018-005/)).
- The default value for the `RESOURCES_DIR` const has been changed to to "_resources"
  - The `Library::DEFAULT_RESOURCES_DIR` const in `silverstripe/vendor-plugin` has been changed to match.
  - This can still be customised using `extra.resources-dir` in your composer.json file ([see relevant docs](developer_guides/templates/requirements/#configuring-your-project-exposed-folders))
  - If your composer.json file has its `extra.resources-dir` key set to `_resources`, you can remove that now.
  - If your composer.json file already does not have an `extra.resources-dir` key and you want to keep your resources in the `resources` directory, you can set `extra.resources-dir` to "resources".
  - If your composer.json file already does not have an `extra.resources-dir` key and you want to use the new default `_resources` directory, you may need to check that your code and templates don't assume the directory name for those resources. In your templates it is preferred to [use `$resourePath()` or `$resourceURL()`](developer_guides/templates/requirements/#direct-resource-urls) to get paths for resources.
- `SilverStripe\Dev\FunctionalTest` is now abstract.
- `SilverStripe\Dev\MigrationTask` is now abstract.
- `SilverStripe\Dev\SapphireTest` is now abstract.
- `SilverStripe\Core\Extensible::invokeWithExtensions()` and `SilverStripe\Core\Extensible::extend()` now use the splat operator instead of having a concrete number of possible arguments.
- The constructor for `SilverStripe\Versioned\Versioned` now explicitly only accepts mode as a single argument.
- The following classes have been moved from `silverstripe/cms` to `silverstripe/admin` and renamed:
  - `SilverStripe\CMS\Controllers\SilverStripeNavigator` is now in silverstripe/admin as `SilverStripe\Admin\Navigator\SilverStripeNavigator`
  - `SilverStripe\CMS\Controllers\SilverStripeNavigatorItem` is now in silverstripe/admin as `SilverStripe\Admin\Navigator\SilverStripeNavigatorItem`
  - `SilverStripe\CMS\Controllers\SilverStripeNavigatorItem_Unversioned` is now in silverstripe/admin as `SilverStripe\Admin\Navigator\SilverStripeNavigatorItem_Unversioned`
- The following classes have been moved from `silverstripe/cms` to `silverstripe/versioned-admin` and renamed:
  - `SilverStripe\CMS\Controllers\SilverStripeNavigatorItem_ArchiveLink` is now in silverstripe/versioned as `SilverStripe\VersionedAdmin\Navigator\SilverStripeNavigatorItem_ArchiveLink`
  - `SilverStripe\CMS\Controllers\SilverStripeNavigatorItem_LiveLink` is now in silverstripe/versioned as `SilverStripe\VersionedAdmin\Navigator\SilverStripeNavigatorItem_LiveLink`
  - `SilverStripe\CMS\Controllers\SilverStripeNavigatorItem_StageLink` is now in silverstripe/versioned as `SilverStripe\VersionedAdmin\Navigator\SilverStripeNavigatorItem_StageLink`

### ORM {#api-orm}

- Prior to 5.0.0, when using `SQLSelect::setFrom()` or `SQLSelect::create('*', $from)` to set table or subselect definitions,
their aliases (applied by setting a string key for the array) were being ignored. This bug has been fixed - if you were working around this by manually setting the alias e.g. in a join, you can remove those workarounds now.
- [Query](api:SilverStripe\ORM\Connect\Query) now implements `IteratorAggregate` instead of `Iterator`. This means `seek()` and other iterator methods are no longer available on this class and its subclasses. Use `getIterator()` instead.
- [DataList](SilverStripe\ORM\DataList), its subclasses, [Map](api:SilverStripe\ORM\Map), and [ArrayList](SilverStripe\ORM\ArrayList) all now return generators from `getIterator()`. This reduces memory usage when looping over large result sets. As a result of this, `getGenerator()` has been removed as it is no longer needed. Note that `chunkedFetch()` has not been removed, as it may still be useful for very large result sets to fetch results in smaller chunks at a time.

## Dependency changes

- Various Symfony dependencies have been upgraded from 4.x to 6.x. A small number of code changes were made in silverstripe/framework to work with the symfony 6.x dependencies.
- silverstripe/graphql v3 is no longer supported. It is recommended that you ensure you are using graphl v4 in your Silverstripe CMS 4 project before upgrading to Silverstripe CMS 5. There is [documentation for the upgrade process here](https://docs.silverstripe.org/en/4/upgrading/upgrading_to_graphql_4/).
- PHPUnit 5.7 is no longer supported. It is recommended that you ensure your tests are running with PHPUnit 9 in your Silverstripe CMS 4 project before upgrading to Silverstripe CMS 5. There is [documentation for the upgrade process here](https://docs.silverstripe.org/en/4/upgrading/phpunit9/).

## Features and enhancements {#features-and-enhancements}

### Extension changes
[Extension](api:SilverStripe\Core\Extension) classes don't expose `protected` methods, but they _can_ be used for extension hooks. This reduces the surface of methods exposed from your extensions into `Extensible` classes. For example, you might have a `protected function updateCMSFields()` method which will be called after writing some `DataObject` - but because this method is `protected`, it _cannot_ be accessed directly from the `DataObject` instances. You can however still expose some method from the `Extension` by making it `public` - and that method _can_ be accessed directly from the `DataObject` instances.

When invoking an extension hook (e.g. via `extend()`), methods prefixed with "extend" will take precendence. i.e. if an `Extension` class has a `onAfterWrite()` method and an `extendOnAfterWrite()` method and I call `$this->extend('onAfterWrite')` - the `extendOnAfterWrite()` method on that `Extension` will be called, and `onAfterWrite()` will not.  
This empowers advanced `Extension` functionality such as [Versioned::canPublish()](api:SilverStripe\Versioned\Versioned::canPublish()) which invokes `$owner->extendedCan('canPublish')` but doesn't result in a cycle, because the same class also implements [extendCanPublish()](api:SilverStripe\Versioned\Versioned::extendCanPublish()).

### Other new features {#other-features}

- [DataObject::get_one()][api:SilverStripe\ORM\DataObject::get_one()] can now be called directly from subclasses of `DataObject` without passing in a class as the first argument (e.g. `SiteTree::get_one(filter: ['Title:startsWith' => 'About'])`).

## Bugfixes {#bugfixes}

- If a page which is a child of a root-level page gets archived, and then its former parent is removed, it can only be restored if `can_be_root` for that page's class is true.

This release includes a number of bug fixes to improve a broad range of areas. Check the change logs for full details of these fixes split by module. Thank you to the community members that helped contribute these fixes as part of the release!

## Environment variable changes

- `SS_MANIFESTCACHE` can no longer use the now removed symfony/cache 4.x "Simple" cache classes e.g. `Symfony\Component\Cache\Simple\PhpFilesCache`. Instead use the corresponding "Adapter" class e.g. `Symfony\Component\Cache\Adapter\PhpFilesAdapter`.
