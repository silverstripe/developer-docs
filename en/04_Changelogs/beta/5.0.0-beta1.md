# Silverstripe CMS 5.0.0-beta1 (unreleased)

This is the first beta release for Silverstripe CMS 5. This is a pre-release version of Silverstripe CMS 5. It is not suitable for a production environment.

We are anticipating that we will tag a Silverstripe CMS 5 Release Candidate (RC) in March 2023 and a stable release in April 2023.

## About the Beta release

### Trying the beta

Creating a Silverstripe CMS 5 test project is just as easy as with Silverstripe CMS 4. Simply run this command to try out the Silverstripe CMS 5 beta.

```bash
composer create-project silverstripe/installer:5.0.0-beta1 my-site
```

Silverstripe CMS 5 requires at least PHP 8.1.

Review the [Server Requirements](/getting_started/server_requirements) for all the details.

## Reporting bugs

If you find a bugs in the beta, report it by creating an issue against the relevant GitHub repository. Prefix the title of your issue with "CMS5-beta" to make it easier for our development team to identify it.

Look at [Reporting Bugs](/contributing/issues_and_bugs) for more informations.

After creating an issue, maybe have a go at creating a pull request to fix it. Remember to link back your pull request to a matching issue to help the CMS development team review your work.

Read our [Contributing Code](/contributing/code/) documentation for more details on opening pull requests.

### Change freeze

Now that the Silverstripe CMS 5 beta has been tagged, our aim is to:
- make no further breaking API changes to the CMS5 codebase
- have all supported dependencies upgraded to a supported major version.

We recognize that beta testing may bring to our attention bugs or problems that can not be easily remedied without a breaking API change.

We will only consider merging post-beta breaking API changes if they are necessary to address a high impact flaw in the CMS5 code base. Each of those breaking API changes will have to be individually approved by the CMS Squad team lead.

Non-breaking API changes and enhancements may be merged after the initial CMS 5 beta release.

### Known issues

The Silverstripe CMS 5 beta 1 release contains several known regressions. We'll aim to address those prior the Silverstripe CMS 5 Release candidate. There are likely also other regressions we have yet to find.

#### Regressions

- [Yubikey registration fails](https://github.com/silverstripe/silverstripe-webauthn-authenticator/issues/124)
- [JavaScript CI tests are broken](https://github.com/silverstripe/silverstripe-admin/issues/1421)
- [React context no longer has "You have unsaved changes" confirm dialog](https://github.com/silverstripe/silverstripe-admin/issues/1409)
- [Cannot delete image in WYSIWYG with delete button](https://github.com/silverstripe/silverstripe-admin/issues/1410)
- [Console error whenever a toast pops up](https://github.com/silverstripe/silverstripe-admin/issues/1412)

#### Build failures

Some modules are failing one or more Continuous Integration job. We've looked at these and decided that none of the failures are critical or warrants holding back the beta release. These are all either problems with out CI build system itself or indications of non-critical regressions.

## Upgrading your third party module

One of the primary purposes of the beta testing phase is to give third party maintainers and developers an opportunity to upgrade their modules to be compatible with Silverstripe CMS 5.

### Planning your upgrade

You should decide if you intend to do a new major release of your module to add support for Silverstripe CMS 5.

Most of the key Silverstripe CMS APIs have not changed between CMS 4 and CMS 5. That said, take time to read this changelog to identify changes that might be problematic for your project.

Depending on how complex your module is, it may be completely practical to create a version that works with both Silverstripe CMS 4 and Silverstripe CMS 5. We do not necessarily recommend this approach. It may require you to tag a major release later on if you want to make use of new Silverstripe CMS 5 feature later on. But you may wish to consider this approach to minimise your maintenance burden.

If you decide that you want to maintain distinct Silverstripe CMS 4 and Silverstripe CMS 5 versions of your module, then you should create a new branch from your current development branch.

For example, let's assume your CMS 4 branch is called `main` and the current stable release of your module is `3.2.1`:
- Create a new `3` branch from `main`. This branch will be used to tag future releases of your modules for CMS 4.
- `main` will now be used to release a CMS 5 version of your module. All CMS 5 upgrade commits should be merged in `main`.
- To patch bugs against both the CMS 4 and CMS 5 versions of your module, merge the fix in the `3` branch. Then merge the `3` branch into `main`.


[info]
If the name of your branch is a number, composer will allow it to be installed as an unstable tag. e.g.: If your module has a `7` branch, composer will alias the `HEAD` of that branch as `7.x-dev`. This will satisfy a constraint like `^7`. This is especially useful for some development pipelines and for running tests in a continuous integration environment like Github Actions.
[/info]

### Stop using deprecated code

A good way to identify which APIs need to be updated is to [enable deprecation warnings](/Upgrading/Deprecations) and run your module in a fresh project using the latest Silverstripe CMS 4 release. This will let you remove any references to deprecated APIs in the Silverstripe CMS 4 version of your module.

If you intend to remove some APIs in the Silverstripe CMS 5 version of your module, consider [adding deprecation warnings](/contributing/release_process#deprecating-api) to the Silverstripe CMS 4 version. This will simplify the upgrade process for projects using your module.

### Upgrade your constraints

Upgrade your composer requirement constraints to allow the installation of Silverstripe CMS 5 module. If your module has dual support for Silverstripe CMS 4 and 5, you'll want to use a constraint similar to:
```json
"require": {
    "silverstripe/framework": "^4 || ^5",
    "silverstripe/cms": "^4 || ^5",
    "silverstripe/admin": "^1 || ^2"
}
```

Otherwise, simply increment your existing constraints to target the Silverstripe CMS 5 version of our modules.

### Ship a Silverstripe CMS 5 version of your module

You should ideally test your module against at least one real Silverstripe CMS 5 project to identify and fix real-world problems. Consider tagging a beta release to give your users a chance to test drive your module with the Silverstripe CMS 5 beta. This will both help you resolve any regressions you hadn't found yourself and give your users a chance to update any modules _they_ might have which rely on yours.
