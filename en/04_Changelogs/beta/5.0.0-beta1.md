# 5.0.0-beta1

This is the first beta release for Silverstripe CMS 5. This is a pre-release version of Silverstripe CMS 5. It is not suitable for a production environment.

We are anticipating that we will tag a Silverstripe CMS 5 Release Candidate (RC) in March 2023 and a stable release in April 2023.

## About the Beta release {#about-the-beta-release}

### Trying the beta {#trying-the-beta}

Creating a Silverstripe CMS 5 test project is just as easy as with Silverstripe CMS 4. Simply run this command to try out the Silverstripe CMS 5 beta.

```bash
composer create-project silverstripe/installer:5.0.0-beta1 my-site
```

Silverstripe CMS 5 requires at least PHP 8.1.

Review the [Server Requirements](/getting_started/server_requirements) for all the details.

### Reporting bugs {#reporting-bugs}

If you find a bugs in the beta, report it by creating an issue against the relevant GitHub repository. Prefix the title of your issue with "CMS5-beta" to make it easier for our development team to identify it.

Look at [Reporting Bugs](/contributing/issues_and_bugs) for more informations.

After creating an issue, maybe have a go at creating a pull request to fix it. Remember to link back your pull request to a matching issue to help the CMS development team review your work.

Read our [Contributing Code](/contributing/code/) documentation for more details on opening pull requests.

### Change freeze {#change-freeze}

Now that the Silverstripe CMS 5 beta has been tagged, our aim is to:
- make no further breaking API changes to the CMS5 codebase
- have all supported dependencies upgraded to a supported major version.

We recognize that beta testing may bring to our attention bugs or problems that can not be easily remedied without a breaking API change.

We will only consider merging post-beta breaking API changes if they are necessary to address a high impact flaw in the CMS5 code base. Each of those breaking API changes will have to be individually approved by the CMS Squad team lead.

Non-breaking API changes and enhancements may be merged after the initial CMS 5 beta release.

### Known issues {#known-issues}

The Silverstripe CMS 5 beta 1 release contains several known regressions. We'll aim to address those prior the Silverstripe CMS 5 Release candidate. There are likely also other regressions we have yet to find.

#### Regressions

- [JavaScript CI tests are broken](https://github.com/silverstripe/silverstripe-admin/issues/1421)
- [React context no longer has "You have unsaved changes" confirm dialog](https://github.com/silverstripe/silverstripe-admin/issues/1409)
- [Cannot delete image in WYSIWYG with delete button](https://github.com/silverstripe/silverstripe-admin/issues/1410)
- [Console error whenever a toast pops up](https://github.com/silverstripe/silverstripe-admin/issues/1412)

#### Build failures

Some modules are failing one or more Continuous Integration job. We've looked at these and decided that none of the failures are critical or warrants holding back the beta release. These are all either problems with out CI build system itself or indications of non-critical regressions.

## Upgrading your third party module {#upgrading-your-third-party-module}

One of the primary purposes of the beta testing phase is to give third party maintainers and developers an opportunity to upgrade their modules to be compatible with Silverstripe CMS 5.

### Planning your upgrade {#planning-your-upgrade}

You should decide if you intend to do a new major release of your module to add support for Silverstripe CMS 5.

Most of the key Silverstripe CMS APIs have not changed between CMS 4 and CMS 5. That said, take time to read this changelog to identify changes that might be problematic for your project.

Depending on how complex your module is, it may be completely practical to create a version that works with both Silverstripe CMS 4 and Silverstripe CMS 5. We do not necessarily recommend this approach as it may require you to tag a major release later on if you want to make use of new Silverstripe CMS 5 features later on. But you may wish to consider this approach to minimise your maintenance burden.

If you decide that you want to maintain distinct Silverstripe CMS 4 and Silverstripe CMS 5 versions of your module, then you should create a new branch from your current development branch.

For example, let's assume your CMS 4 branch is called `main` and the current stable release of your module is `3.2.1`:
- Create a new `3` branch from `main`. This branch will be used to tag future releases of your modules for CMS 4.
- `main` will now be used to release a CMS 5 version of your module. All CMS 5 upgrade commits should be merged in `main`.
- To patch bugs against both the CMS 4 and CMS 5 versions of your module, merge the fix in the `3` branch. Then merge the `3` branch into `main`.


[info]
If the name of your branch is a number, composer will allow it to be installed as an unstable tag. e.g.: If your module has a `7` branch, composer will alias the `HEAD` of that branch as `7.x-dev`. This will satisfy a constraint like `^7`. This is especially useful for some development pipelines and for running tests in a continuous integration environment like Github Actions.
[/info]

### Stop using deprecated code {#stop-using-deprecated-code}

A good way to identify which APIs need to be updated is to [enable deprecation warnings](/Upgrading/Deprecations) and run your module in a fresh project using the latest Silverstripe CMS 4 release. This will let you remove any references to deprecated APIs in the Silverstripe CMS 4 version of your module.

If you intend to remove some APIs in the Silverstripe CMS 5 version of your module, consider [adding deprecation warnings](/contributing/release_process#deprecating-api) to the Silverstripe CMS 4 version. This will simplify the upgrade process for projects using your module.

### Upgrade your constraints {#upgrade-your-constraints}

Upgrade your composer requirement constraints to allow the installation of Silverstripe CMS 5 module. If your module has dual support for Silverstripe CMS 4 and 5, you'll want to use a constraint similar to:
```json
"require": {
    "silverstripe/framework": "^4 || ^5",
    "silverstripe/cms": "^4 || ^5",
    "silverstripe/admin": "^1 || ^2"
}
```

Otherwise, simply increment your existing constraints to target the Silverstripe CMS 5 version of our modules.

### Ship a Silverstripe CMS 5 version of your module {#ship-a-silverstripe-cms-5-version-of-your-module}

You should ideally test your module against at least one real Silverstripe CMS 5 project to identify and fix real-world problems. Consider tagging a beta release to give your users a chance to test drive your module with the Silverstripe CMS 5 beta. This will both help you resolve any regressions you hadn't found yourself and give your users a chance to update any modules _they_ might have which rely on yours.

## Change to commercially supported modules {#supported-modules}

Some Silverstripe CMS modules are commercially supported. Silverstripe commits to looking after those modules for the duration of the Silverstripe CMS 5 lifecycle.

Review the list of [Commercially Supported Modules for Silverstripe CMS 5](/project_governance/supported_modules).

### Modules not supported going forward {#modules-not-supported-going-forward}

Some modules that were commercially supported in Silverstripe CMS 4 will not be supported in Silverstripe CMS 5. Some of those modules will provide CMS5-compatible versions which will be tagged during this release. Others will be dropped altogether.

Just because a module is not "commercially supported", doesn't mean that you shouldn't be using it. Community supported modules are maintained on a "best-effort" basis. You should take this into consideration when choosing to install a community supported module in your project.

Email [community@silverstripe.org](mailto:community@silverstripe.org) if you are keen to help maintain some of the modules that will no longer be commercially supported.

## Fixed dependencies {#fixed-dependencies}

Silverstripe CMS relies on third party dependencies to implement many features. We have defined several *fixed dependencies* to provide certainty to Silverstripe CMS project owners and minimise the risk of composer conflicts. These dependencies will not be upgraded to new major versions within the Silverstripe CMS 5 release line.

Review [Silverstripe CMS 5 fixed dependencies](/project_governance/fixed_dependencies) for more details.

## Dependency changes {#dependency-changes}

### General changes {#dep-general}

- `swiftmailer/swiftmailer` has been removed and replaced with `symfony/mailer`
- Various Symfony dependencies have been upgraded from 4.x to 6.x. A small number of code changes were made in `silverstripe/framework` to work with the symfony 6.x dependencies.
- `silverstripe/graphql` v3 is no longer supported. It is recommended that you ensure you are using `silverstripe/graphl` v4 in your Silverstripe CMS 4 project before upgrading to Silverstripe CMS 5. There is [documentation for the upgrade process here](https://docs.silverstripe.org/en/4/upgrading/upgrading_to_graphql_4/).
- PHPUnit 5.7 is no longer supported. It is recommended that you ensure your tests are running with PHPUnit 9 in your Silverstripe CMS 4 project before upgrading to Silverstripe CMS 5. There is [documentation for the upgrade process here](https://docs.silverstripe.org/en/4/upgrading/phpunit9/).
- `masterminds/html5` is now used to parse HTML content instead of `DomDocument::loadHTML()`. This may cause slight changes in rendered content if the content being saved contains invalid HTML. The optional module `silverstripe/html5` is no longer required for rendering HTML 5 content.

### TinyMCE upgraded from 4 to 6 {#tinymce6}

TinyMCE has been upgraded up two major versions from 4 to 6. The API for [`HTMLEditorConfig`](api:SilverStripe\Forms\HTMLEditor\HTMLEditorConfig) and [`TinyMCEConfig`](api:SilverStripe\Forms\HTMLEditor\TinyMCEConfig) haven't changed at all, but there have been some changes to plugins and options which may affect your projects. Here are some notable changes:

- The `styleselect` option for selecting a css style has changed to `styles`.
- The `spellchecker` plugin is now a premium "[Spell Checker Pro](https://www.tiny.cloud/docs/tinymce/6/introduction-to-tiny-spellchecker/)" plugin through TinyMCE cloud (though the `browser_spellcheck` options still works and is enabled by default).
- The *paste from Microsoft Word* functionality is now part of a premium "[PowerPaste](https://www.tiny.cloud/docs/tinymce/6/introduction-to-powerpaste/)" plugin through TinyMCE cloud.
  - There is an [open call for maintainers](https://github.com/tinymce/tinymce/discussions/7487) for converting the old functionality into a new open source plugin.
- The UI API has changed, which will affect any custom plugins you may be using. Notably:
  - most `addX()` functions have been moved from `editor` to `editor.ui.registry` - e.g. `editor.addButton()` is now `editor.ui.registry.addButton()`.
  - `onclick` functions on buttons have been changed to `onAction`.

There were a lot more changes than just those, so you may want to also check out the following resources:

- [Docs for upgrading from 4 to 5](https://www.tiny.cloud/docs/migration-from-4x/)
- [Docs for upgrading from 5 to 6](https://www.tiny.cloud/docs/tinymce/6/migration-from-5x/)
- [List of open source plugins for TinyMCE 6](https://www.tiny.cloud/docs/tinymce/6/plugins/#open-source-plugins)
- [List of toolbar buttons available for TinyMCE 6](https://www.tiny.cloud/docs/tinymce/6/available-toolbar-buttons/)
- [Create a plugin](https://www.tiny.cloud/docs/tinymce/6/creating-a-plugin/)

## Front-end build stack upgrades {#front-end}

[info]
"Front-end" in this section refers to the javascript and css in the CMS. It doesn't have any impact on your website's public-facing front-end.
[/info]

We've upgraded the front-end build stack for the CMS, along with most of the javascript dependencies.

### Webpack config {#webpack-config}

The [`@silverstripe/webpack-config`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@silverstripe/webpack-config) and [`@silverstripe/eslint-config`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@silverstripe/eslint-config) NPM libraries, along with the build stack for all supported modules, has been updated to be compatible with node 18 and webpack 5. This will only impact you if your module or project uses one or both of those NPM packages - you will need to make sure you update your own dependencies to be compatible with them, along with the dependencies listed below if you use them.

With this comes a change to the API for `@silverstripe/webpack-config`. There is a new (optional) abstracted API for declaring the webpack config for transpiling the javascript and css for your CMS customisations, which has been documented extensively in the readme for that library.

You can continue to use the old API if you want to, but you will need to account for the following breaking changes:

- The `UglifyJsPlugin` is no longer used to remove comments from transpiled code. Refer to the `optimisation` config in [the abstracted JavascriptWebpackConfig class](https://github.com/silverstripe/webpack-config/blob/2/configMeta/javascriptWebpackConfig.js) instead.
- `script-loader`, `file-loader`, and `url-loader` have all been replaced with the relevant [webpack assets](https://webpack.js.org/guides/asset-modules/) configuration.
- `ExtractTextPlugin` and its associated configuration has been replaced with `MiniCssExtractPlugin`.
- Supported browser configuration has been replaced with setting an appropriate [browserslist](https://browsersl.ist) configuration in your `package.json` file.

### Updated javascript dependencies {#updated-javascript-dependencies}

The following javascript dependencies (which are used in the CMS, and may impact your customisations) have been updated to new major versions, or replaced:

### Common upgrade patterns {#common-upgrade-patterns}

While upgrading core modules, there were a few common patterns we found that might be useful for you. Those are listed here for your convenience.

#### `ReactDOM.render()` replaced with `ReactDOM.createRoot().render()`

If you are injecting a React component in a section of the CMS that uses entwine, you likely have something like this:

```js
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';

$('.grid-field').entwine({
  onmatch() {
    ReactDOM.render(<MyComponent />, this[0]);
  },

  onunmatch() {
    const container = this[0];
    if (container) {
      ReactDOM.unmountComponentAtNode(container);
    }
  },
});
```

Instead of using `ReactDOM.render()`, you should now call `ReactDOM.createRoot().render()` - but if you try to use `createRoot()` multiple times on the same element, react will complain, so you'll want to keep a reference to the root you made the first time. The above example turns into this:

```js
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';

$('.grid-field').entwine({
  ReactRoot: null,

  onmatch() {
    let root = this.getReactRoot();
    if (!root) {
      root = ReactDOM.createRoot(this[0]);
    }
    root.render(<MyComponent />);
    this.setReactRoot(root);
  },

  onunmatch() {
    const root = this.getReactRoot();
    if (root) {
      root.unmount();
      this.setReactRoot(null);
    }
  },
});
```

#### React route paths are now relative to their parent routes

The update to `react-router` has changed the paths for routes in react-only sections of the CMS (such as /admin/assets) to be relative to the parent routes. If you have a custom react CMS section, you'll need to make sure you're using the relative path. This is included as `reactRoutePath` in the array returned by [`LeftAndMain::getClientConfig()`](api:SilverStripe\Admin\LeftAndMain::getClientConfig()) by default, but you may need to double check your custom admin section is returning the correct value.

Then, in your javascript implementation where you are adding your route to the `ReactRouteRegister`, simple change your route's path from using the `url` key to use the new `reactRoutePath` key.

```diff
  import ConfigHelpers from 'lib/Config';
  import reactRouteRegister from 'lib/ReactRouteRegister';
  import MyAdmin from './MyAdmin';

  document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', () => {
      const sectionConfig = ConfigHelpers.getSection('MyAdmin');
      reactRouteRegister.add({
-         path: sectionConfig.url,
+         path: sectionConfig.reactRoutePath,
          component: MyAdminComponent,
      });
  });
```

#### `react-router` no longer has a `withRouter` HOC

In the old version of react-router, the `withRouter` Higher Order Component could be used to wrap your component which needs access to the router and its functionality.

This has been removed. The ideal way to upgrade will be to rewrite your components to work with the new API as per the upgrade guide referenced in the table above.

If you don't have time or resources to rewrite your components, we do have a temporary solution for you - but bear in mind that this is just kicking the can down the road. You _will_ have to upgrade to use the new react-router API eventually.

Silverstripe CMS 5 includes a replacement `withRouter` Higher Order Component that you can use until you have the resources necessary to upgrade properly. It passes different props than the old one did, so you will still need to make some changes. For example:

```js
import React, { Component } from 'react';
import PropTypes from 'prop-types';
import { withRouter } from 'react-router-dom';

class MyAdmin extends Component {
  // Your implementation here
}

MyAdmin.propTypes = {
  location: PropTypes.shape({
    pathname: PropTypes.string,
    query: PropTypes.object,
    search: PropTypes.string,
  }),
  match: PropTypes.shape({
    params: PropTypes.shape({
      view: PropTypes.string,
      id: PropTypes.number,
    }),
  }),
  history: PropTypes.object,
};

export default withRouter(MyAdmin);
```

The above expects the `match` and `history` props from the `withRouter` HOC. These are no longer passed. What's more, you don't have to declare your own proptypes, we've exported that for you. The above now becomes this:

```js
import React, { Component } from 'react';
import withRouter, { routerPropTypes } from 'lib/withRouter';

class MyAdmin extends Component {
  // Your implementation here
}

MyAdmin.propTypes = {
  router: routerPropTypes,
};

export default withRouter(MyAdmin);
```

The new props that our `withRouter` HOC passes in is a single prop called `router` which has the following `PropTypes` definition:

```js
PropTypes.shape({
  location: PropTypes.shape({
    pathname: PropTypes.string,
    query: PropTypes.object,
    search: PropTypes.string,
  }),
  navigate: PropTypes.func,
  params: PropTypes.object,
})
```

`router.params` is a one-to-one replacement for the old `match.params`, and `router.location` is a one-to-one replacement for the old `location` prop.

Refer to the upgrade guide from the table above to learn how to replace the old `history` prop with the new `router.navigate` prop.

### Breaking changes in _our_ javascript components or API {#js-api}

For the most part we were able to retain our existing API and not make any drastic changes to our react components through upgrading our dependencies, but there was one notable exception.

To conform with the API changes in the new version of `react-select`, the `TreeDropdownField` component has changed considerably, and the `TreeDropdownFieldMenu` component has been removed entirely.

If you were customising the `TreeDropdownField` React component at all or injecting a custom version of `TreeDropdownFieldMenu`, you will want to take a look at the source code for the `TreeDropdownField` component and maybe have a look at the upgrade guides for `react-select` referenced in the table above to see what changes you need to make.

Some of the css classes related to `TreeDropdownField` have also changed, as a result of the upgrade to `react-select`.

## Other breaking changes {#other-breaking-changes}

### URLs generated by Silverstripe CMS don't include a trailing slash by default {#trailing-slash}

The URLs generated by Silverstripe CMS have previously been inconsistent as to whether a trailing slash is included or not. This lead to the creation of [at least one module](https://github.com/axllent/silverstripe-trailing-slash) which normalises the trailing slash at the end of URLs.

By default, all URLs created by Silverstripe will now _not_ end with a slash. You can configure this to instead explicitly add a trailing slash to all URLs with the following YML configuration:

```yml
SilverStripe\Control\Controller:
    add_trailing_slash: true
```

[warning]
Because this can be controlled with configuration, it is best practice to avoid explicitly expecting a trailing slash to either be present or be omitted.

In PHP, you can use methods like [`Controller::join_links()`](api:SilverStripe\Control\Controller::join_links()) or [`Controller::normaliseTrailingSlash()`](api:SilverStripe\Control\Controller::normaliseTrailingSlash()). In JavaScript in your CMS customisations, we recommend using using the `joinUrlPaths()` utility function `silverstripe/admin` which you can access with `import { joinUrlPaths } from 'lib/urls;` if your project uses [@silverstripe/webpack-config](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@silverstripe/webpack-config). In your templates, you should use appropriate methods from your controller or model such as [`SiteTree::Link()`](api:SilverStripe\CMS\Model\SiteTree::Link()) which uses `Controller::join_links()` under the hood.
[/warning]

The [`CanonicalURLMiddleware`](api:SilverStripe\Control\Middleware\CanonicalURLMiddleware) will also, by default, redirect traffic to include or omit the trailing slash according to the above configuration. By default, this means that traffic directed to `/about-us/` will be redirected to `/about-us`. You can disable this behaviour with the following YML configuration:

```yml
SilverStripe\Core\Injector\Injector:
  SilverStripe\Control\Middleware\CanonicalURLMiddleware:
    properties:
      enforceTrailingSlashConfig: false
```

[info]
Redirects will not be performed for any route starting with `admin/` or `dev/` by default. You can configure this, as well as exclude specific user agents from being redirected, with the following YML configuration:

```yml
SilverStripe\Core\Injector\Injector:
  SilverStripe\Control\Middleware\CanonicalURLMiddleware:
    properties:
      enforceTrailingSlashConfigIgnorePaths:
        - 'my-ajax-controller/'
      enforceTrailingSlashConfigIgnoreUserAgents:
        - 'my-dev-user-agent'
```

[/info]

### CWP Agency Extensions {#cwp-agency-extensions}

The [cwp/agency-extensions](https://github.com/silverstripe/cwp-agencyextensions) module used to provide a Font Awesome v4 plugin for TinyMCE 4. This plugin is not compatible with TinyMCE 6 and we couldn't see an appropriate alternative plugin to use instead. The fact that such a replacement doesn't seem to exist in the wild suggests to us that the use-case is very narrow, so we have opted to remove this plugin without replacing it.

If your project has no content which used the Font Awesome plugin provided by this module, you don't need to make any changes - though you can remove the `CWP_AGENCY_DISABLE_FONTAWESOME_PLUGIN` environment variable from your `.env` file if it was set.

If your project does have some content which contains Font Awesome icons from that plugin, you will need to set `CWP_AGENCY_ENABLE_FONTAWESOME_STYLES` to true in your environment variables. This will allow you to see the existing icons in the TinyMCE field in the CMS, as well as ensuring that they will not be removed when you save content. The front-end will not be impacted, as you already had to inject an appropriate stylesheet into the front-end for the icons to appear there.

If you cannot set environment variables in your project, you can set the following configuration manually in your project:

**_config.php**
```php
use SilverStripe\Forms\HTMLEditor\TinyMCEConfig;

TinyMCEConfig::get('cwp')->setOption(
    'extended_valid_elements',
    $cwpEditor->getOption('extended_valid_elements')
    . ',span[class|align|style|aria-hidden]'
);
```

**_config/font-awesome.yml**
```yml
SilverStripe\Forms\HTMLEditor\TinyMCEConfig:
  editor_css:
    - "https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/font-awesome/4.7.0/css/font-awesome.min.css"
```

If you need the ability to add icons in your content, a suitable alternative may be the [emoticons plugin for TinyMCE 6](https://www.tiny.cloud/docs/plugins/opensource/emoticons/). You can compare the icons provided by that plugin with the [icons in Font Awesome v4](https://fontawesome.com/v4/icons/) to see if it would be a suitable replacement for your project.

### silverstripe/security-extensions module is folded into core {#security-extensions-is-core}

The functionality from [silverstripe/security-extensions](https://github.com/silverstripe/silverstripe-security-extensions) has been folded into the core modules. This means you no longer need to install that module to benefit from the features it provided - and indeed there will not be a CMS 5 compatible version of that module. If you have `silverstripe/security-extensions` as a dependency in your composer.json file, you will need to remove it.

With this change you now have access to the following features:

#### Require password change on next log in

Administrators with the ability to administer members can see a checkbox in the CMS under the area to set the member's password. Checking this box will set the password expiry to the current date, meaning the next time the member logs in they will be required to choose a new password for their account.

No change is made when setting this field and the password is already expired for auditing purposes (an administrator could see how long ago a password expired). Similarly no change is made when unsetting this field and the expiry date is in the future, it should remain so - the checkbox is for immediately requiring a new password on the _next_ log in.

See the [secure coding section](/developer_guides/security/secure_coding/#other-options) for information about setting the password expiry itself, or the ["Changing and managing users" user help guide](https://userhelp.silverstripe.org/en/5/managing_your_website/changing_and_managing_users/#changing-a-user-s-password) to see how this appears to the user.

#### Sudo mode

Sudo mode represents a heightened level of permission in that you are more certain that the current user is actually the person whose account is logged in. This is performed by re-validating that the account's password is correct, and will then last for a certain amount of time (configurable) until it will be checked again.

Out of the box this is currently only used by the [silverstripe/mfa](https://github.com/silverstripe/silverstripe-mfa) module - see [MAnaging your MFA settings](https://userhelp.silverstripe.org/en/5/optional_features/multi-factor_authentication/user_manual/managing_your_mfa_settings/#managing-your-mfa-settings) - but you can use it in your own projects as well. Read the [Sudo Mode documentation](/developer_guides/security/sudo_mode/) to find out how.

Note that as part of this change the namespaces of several classes changed. Refer to the table below if you were referring to these classes (e.g. to set configuration values or replace classes via dependency injection).

|Old namespace|New namespace|
|---|---|
|`SilverStripe\SecurityExtensions\Control\SudoModeController`|[`SilverStripe\Admin\SudoModeController`](api:SilverStripe\Admin\SudoModeController)|
|`SilverStripe\SecurityExtensions\Service\SudoModeService`|[`SilverStripe\Security\SudoMode\SudoModeService`](api:SilverStripe\Security\SudoMode\SudoModeService)|
|`SilverStripe\SecurityExtensions\Service\SudoModeServiceInterface`|[`SilverStripe\Security\SudoMode\SudoModeServiceInterface`](api:SilverStripe\Security\SudoMode\SudoModeServiceInterface)|

## Features and enhancements {#features-and-enhancements}

### Extension changes {#extension-changes}
[Extension](api:SilverStripe\Core\Extension) classes don't expose `protected` methods, but they _can_ be used for extension hooks. This reduces the surface of methods exposed from your extensions into `Extensible` classes. For example, you might have a `protected function updateCMSFields()` method which will be called after writing some `DataObject` - but because this method is `protected`, it _cannot_ be accessed directly from the `DataObject` instances. You can however still expose some method from the `Extension` by making it `public` - and that method _can_ be accessed directly from the `DataObject` instances.

When invoking an extension hook (e.g. via `extend()`), methods prefixed with "extend" will take precedence. i.e. if an `Extension` class has a `onAfterWrite()` method and an `extendOnAfterWrite()` method and I call `$this->extend('onAfterWrite')` - the `extendOnAfterWrite()` method on that `Extension` will be called, and `onAfterWrite()` will not.  
This empowers advanced `Extension` functionality such as [Versioned::canPublish()](api:SilverStripe\Versioned\Versioned::canPublish()) which invokes `$owner->extendedCan('canPublish')` but doesn't result in a cycle, because the same class also implements [extendCanPublish()](api:SilverStripe\Versioned\Versioned::extendCanPublish()).

### Other new features {#other-features}

- [`DataObject::get_one()`](api:SilverStripe\ORM\DataObject::get_one()) can now be called directly from subclasses of `DataObject` without passing in a class as the first argument (e.g. `SiteTree::get_one(filter: ['Title:startsWith' => 'About'])`).
- The elemental [TopPage DataExtension](api:DNADesign\Elemental\TopPage\DataExtension) is applied to [`BaseElement`](api:DNADesign\Elemental\Models\BaseElement) and [`ElementalArea`](api:DNADesign\Elemental\Models\ElementalArea) by default, and the corresponding [`SiteTreeExtension`](api:DNADesign\Elemental\TopPage\SiteTreeExtension) is applied to [`SiteTree`](api:SilverStripe\CMS\Model\SiteTree) by default. This allows you to use `$TopPage` in your elemental block templates as a more performant alternative to `$Page` when referring to the page the element belongs to.
- Void HTML elements such as `<img>` are no longer rendered as self-closing tags e.g. `<img src="foo" alt="bar">` is now rendered, previously `<img src="foo" alt="bar" />` was rendered.

## Bugfixes {#bugfixes}

- If a page which is a child of a root-level page gets archived, and then its former parent is removed, it can only be restored if `can_be_root` for that page's class is true.

This release includes a number of bug fixes to improve a broad range of areas. Check the change logs for full details of these fixes split by module. Thank you to the community members that helped contribute these fixes as part of the release!

## Environment variable changes {#environment-variable-changes}

- `SS_MANIFESTCACHE` can no longer use the now removed symfony/cache 4.x "Simple" cache classes e.g. `Symfony\Component\Cache\Simple\PhpFilesCache`. Instead use the corresponding "Adapter" class e.g. `Symfony\Component\Cache\Adapter\PhpFilesAdapter`.
- `APP_SMTP_USERNAME` and `APP_SMTP_PASSWORD` have been removed. Use a `MAILER_DSN` environment variable instead to configure SMTP email (see [the email documentation](/developer_guides/email/) for more details).

## API changes {#api-changes}

This is a major release and contains many breaking API changes. Deprecation warnings have been added to the latest Silverstripe CMS 4 release to advise you of APIs that have been removed in Silverstripe CMS 5.

[Enable deprecation warnings](/upgrading/deprecations) prior to upgrading to Silverstripe CMS 5 to see if your project relies on any APIs that are no longer unavailable.

### General changes {#api-general}

- [`SecurityAdmin`](api:SilverStripe\Admin\SecurityAdmin) is a [`SilverStripe\Admin\ModelAdmin`](api:SilverStripe\Admin\ModelAdmin).
  - Previous extension hook implementations of `SecurityAdmin::updateEditForm($form)` still works as the extension hook is called in [`ModelAdmin::getEditForm()`](api:SilverStripe\Admin\ModelAdmin::getEditForm()).
  - The *Users*, *Groups* and *Roles* tabs no longer share the `/admin/security` path and instead have their own dedicated paths. e.g. `/admin/security/users`
- `isDev` and `isTest` query string arguments have been removed due to security concerns (see [ss-2018-005](https://www.silverstripe.org/download/security-releases/ss-2018-005/)).
- The default value for the `RESOURCES_DIR` const has been changed to to "_resources"
  - The [`Library::DEFAULT_RESOURCES_DIR`](api:SilverStripe\VendorPlugin\Library::DEFAULT_RESOURCES_DIR) constant in `silverstripe/vendor-plugin` has been changed to match.
  - This can still be customised using `extra.resources-dir` in your `composer.json` file ([see relevant docs](/developer_guides/templates/requirements/#configuring-your-project-exposed-folders)).
  - If your `composer.json` file has its `extra.resources-dir` key set to `_resources`, you can remove that now.
  - If your `composer.json` file already does not have an `extra.resources-dir` key and you want to keep your resources in the `resources` directory, you can set `extra.resources-dir` to `resources`.
  - If your `composer.json` file already does not have an `extra.resources-dir` key and you want to use the new default `_resources` directory, you may need to check that your code and templates don't assume the directory name for those resources. In your templates it is preferred to [use `$resourePath()` or `$resourceURL()`](/developer_guides/templates/requirements/#direct-resource-urls) to get paths for resources.
- Removed the `HTMLValue` injection "shorthand", use the fully qualified [`HTMLValue`](api:SilverStripe\View\Parsers\HTMLValue) instead.

### Email {#api-email}

- Email was sent in CMS 4 using [SwiftMailer](https://swiftmailer.symfony.com/docs/introduction.html), which has since [gone End Of Life](https://symfony.com/blog/the-end-of-swiftmailer). In CMS 5, this has been replaced with [symfony/mailer](https://symfony.com/doc/current/mailer.html). `symfony/mailer` is the currently maintained email package from Symfony. It's a more flexible email system that allows easier integration with third-party email providers.
- In CMS 4, the [`SilverStripe\Control\Email\Email`](api:SilverStripe\Control\Email\Email) class subclassed [`SilverStripe\View\ViewableData`](api:SilverStripe\View\ViewableData). In CMS 5, it now subclasses `Symfony\Component\Mime\Email`.
- `MailTransport`, which used the php native `mail()` function, is no longer present in CMS 5. This is because [Symfony considers `mail()` to be insecure](https://github.com/swiftmailer/swiftmailer/issues/866#issuecomment-289291228).
- If your site has a custom email configuration e.g. SMTP configuration, this will need to be updated, as the configuration has changed from Silverstripe yml to a much more flexible and standardised [DSN string](https://symfony.com/doc/current/mailer.html#transport-setup). See [the email documentation](/developer_guides/email/) for more details. The configuration for email has changed completely - read the updated documentation carefully.
- The following return types were changed on the following methods in [`SilverStripe\Control\Email\Email`](api:SilverStripe\Control\Email\Email).
  - Used to return a `string`, now returns an nullable [`Address`](https://symfony.com/doc/current/mailer.html#email-addresses) object.
    - `getReturnPath()`
    - `getSender()`
  - Used to return an array of strings, now returns an array of `Address` objects.
    - `getFrom()`
    - `getTo()`
    - `getBCC()` - note - changed casing to `getBcc()`
    - `getCC()` - note - changed casing to `getCc()`
  - Used to return `bool`, now return `void`:
    - [`send()`](api:SilverStripe\Control\Email\Email::send())
    - [`sendPlain()`](api:SilverStripe\Control\Email\Email::sendPlain())
  - Catch [`TransportExceptionInterface`](https://github.com/symfony/symfony/blob/6.2/src/Symfony/Component/Mailer/Exception/TransportExceptionInterface.php) from Symfony Mailer to handle failure to send email.
  - Various other methods have added strong typing to parameter and return types. Also, some parameter names have changed.

### ORM {#api-orm}

- [`DataList::sort()`](api:SilverStripe\ORM\DataList::sort()) no longer accepts raw SQL. A new [`DataList::orderBy()`](api:SilverStripe\ORM\DataList::orderBy()) method has been created which accepts raw SQL, though it's recommended to continue using [`DataList::sort()`](api:SilverStripe\ORM\DataList::sort()) if possible to reduce the chance of SQL injection vulnerabilities.
- Passing `null` to [`DataList::sort()`](api:SilverStripe\ORM\DataList::sort()) i.e. `sort(null)` now clears any existing sort values on a DataList. Passing an empty string (i.e. `sort('')` or array i.e. `sort([])`) now causes an `InvalidArgumentException` to be thrown.
- Prior to 5.0.0, when using [`SQLSelect::setFrom()`](api:SilverStripe\ORM\Queries\SQLSelect::setFrom()) or [`SQLSelect::create('*', $from)`](api:SilverStripe\ORM\Queries\SQLSelect::create) to set table or subselect definitions, their aliases (applied by setting a string key for the array) were being ignored. This bug has been fixed - if you were working around this by manually setting the alias e.g. in a join, you can remove those workarounds now.
- [`Query`](api:SilverStripe\ORM\Connect\Query) now implements `IteratorAggregate` instead of `Iterator`. This means `seek()` and other iterator methods are no longer available on this class and its subclasses. Use `getIterator()` instead.
- [`DataList`](api:SilverStripe\ORM\DataList), its subclasses, [`Map`](api:SilverStripe\ORM\Map), and [`ArrayList`](api:SilverStripe\ORM\ArrayList) all now return generators from `getIterator()`. This reduces memory usage when looping over large result sets. As a result of this, `getGenerator()` has been removed as it is no longer needed. Note that [`DataList::chunkedFetch()`](api:SilverStripe\ORM\DataList::chunkedFetch()) has not been removed, as it may still be useful for very large result sets to fetch results in smaller chunks at a time.
- [`Limitable::limit()`](api:SilverStripe\ORM\Limitable::limit()) is now strongly typed. Calling `limit()` with a `0` or `false` length now limits the list to 0 entry. In Silverstripe CMS 4, any "falsy" value would unset the limit. To unset a list's limit in Silverstripe CMS 5 , call `limit()` with an explicit `null`. This affects [`DataList`](api:SilverStripe\ORM\DataList), [`ArrayList`](api:SilverStripe\ORM\ArrayList) and all other classes implementing [`Limitable`](api:SilverStripe\ORM\Limitable).
  - In Silverstripe CMS 4, calling [`SQLSelect::setLimit()`](api:SilverStripe\ORM\Queries\SQLSelect::setLimit()) with `0` as argument would unset the limit. In Silverstripe CMS 5, it sets a limit of `0` causing the query to return no results. Call `setLimit()` with `null` to unset the limit.
- [`ArrayList::limit()`](api:SilverStripe\ORM\ArrayList::limit()) in Silverstripe CMS 5 throws an `InvalidArgumentException` when called with a negative `$length` or `$offset`.

### Templates {#templates}

- `<% loop %>` and `<% with %>` now only ever result in one new scope level. See [Template Syntax](/developer_guides/templates/syntax#up) for more details.

  For example `<% loop $Pages.Limit(5) %>{$Up.Up.Title}<% end_loop %>` previously would go up once to the `$Pages` scope (out of the `$Pages.limit(5)` scope), then up a second time to the parent scope. Now there is only the parent scope and the `$Pages.limit(5)` scope - there is no implied `$Pages` scope.

  You may need to do a search for `$Up.Up` in your templates to resolve situations where you have worked around this - with the example above, you would need to rewrite it to `$Up.Title` (removing the second `Up`).

- Numeric, boolean and null values passed to methods in templates will now preserve their type, rather than always being cast to strings. E.g. `$Foo(true)` would previously pass a string argument `'true'` to the `Foo()` method, but will now pass an actual boolean.

  You may need to check for situations where you were working around this limitation, such as checking in php code for `$param === 'false'` if you were passing `false` into some method from a template.
