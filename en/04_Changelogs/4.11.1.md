## Upgrade considerations

We recommend that all Silverstripe CMS projects upgrade to a patch version as-soon-as-possible. However, given this release patches 9 individual vulnerabilities, it might be advisable to prioritise deploying the one high impact fix first.

If deploying all 9 patches at once is not practical for you, consider deploying the [CVE-2022-38148 Blind SQL Injection](#CVE-2022-38148) fix first:

- CVE-2022-38148 is the most high impact vulnerability.
- The CVE-2022-38148 patch has been backported to Silverstripe CMS 4.10 as well as 4.11.
- The CVE-2022-38148 patch has very limited risk of regression for existing projects.

Most of the patches in this release have a limited risk of regression. The vast majority of Silverstripe CMS projects should be able to upgrade with little to no work.

If your project uses custom short code providers, you may wish to pay closer attention to the [CVE-2022-38724](CVE-2022-38724) patch and consider adding additional validation around any [custom shortcode](/developer_guides/extending/shortcodes/#defining-custom-shortcodes) attributes.

If your site hosts GPX files, the [CVE-2022-38147](#CVE-2022-38147) patch could be problematic for you. You may need to manually re-enable this file type or stop using these files altogether.


## Security considerations {#security-considerations}

This release includes security fixes. Review the individual vulnerability disclosure for more detailed descriptions of each security fix. We highly encourage upgrading your project to include the latest security patches.

We have provided a high-level severity rating of the vulnerabilities below based on the CVSS score. Note that the impact of each vulnerability could vary based on the specifics of each project. You can [read the severity rating definitions in the Silverstripe CMS release process](/contributing/release_process/#severity-rating).

### CVE-2022-38148 Blind SQL Injection in gridfield state from URL {#CVE-2022-38148}

Prior to this release, gridfield state was vulnerable to an SQL injection vulnerability by providing an invalid sort parameter. To exploit this issue an attacker would need access to a CMS user account. All gridfields in the CMS were potentially affected by this vulnerability.

Because of the high impact of this vulnerability, the fix  has been backported to `silverstripe/framework` 4.10.11 as well.

- Severity: High
- CVSS: [7.1](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:N/E:P/RL:O/RC:C&version=3.1)

### CVE-2022-38146 URL XSS vulnerability due to outdated jQuery in CMS {#CVE-2022-38146}

The Silverstripe CMS UI uses jQuery 1.7.2. This version of jQuery is a affected by [CVE-2019-11358 Object.prototype pollution](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/cve-2019-11358). An attacker could perform an XSS attack by convincing a user to follow a link with a specially crafted url.

`silverstripe/admin` 1.11.3 addresses this problem by stopping all JavaScript execution if the URL contains a specific payload.

Follow up work to upgrade to jQuery 3.6.1 or later will take place in the Silverstripe CMS 4.12.0 release.

- Severity: Medium
- CVSS: [5.4](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N/E:P/RL:O/RC:C&version=3.1)

### CVE-2022-38462 Reflected XSS in backURL get variable {#CVE-2022-38462}

An attacker could perform an XSS attack by inserting an Javascript payload in the `backURL` query string parameter and convincing a user to follow a link.

- Severity: Medium
- CVSS: [4.2](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N&version=3.1)

Read the full [CVE-2022-38462 disclosure](https://https://www.silverstripe.org/download/security-releases/CVE-2022-38462)

### CVE-2022-38724 XSS in shortcodes {#CVE-2022-38724}

A malicious content author could add arbitrary attributes to HTML editor shortcodes which could be used to inject a JavaScript payload on the front end of the site. The shortcode providers that ship with Silverstripe CMS have been reviewed and attribute whitelist have been implemented where appropriate to negate this risk.

If your project include custom shortcode providers, consider reviewing them and implementing a similar whitelist when rendering the shortcodes to HTML.

- Severity: Medium
- CVSS: [4.6](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N/E:P/RL:O/RC:C&version=3.1)

Read the full [CVE-2022-38724 disclosure](https://https://www.silverstripe.org/download/security-releases/CVE-2022-38724)

### CVE-2022-38145 Stored XSS in Compare Mode feature of history view {#CVE-2022-38145}

A malicious content author could add a Javascript payload to a page's meta description and get it executed in the versioned history compare view.

This vulnerability requires access to the CMS to be deployed. The attacker must then convince a privileged user to access the version history for that page.

- Severity: Medium
- CVSS: [4.6](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N/E:P/RL:O/RC:C&version=3.1)

Read the full [CVE-2022-38145 disclosure](https://https://www.silverstripe.org/download/security-releases/CVE-2022-38145)

### CVE-2022-37430 Stored XSS using uppercase characters in HTMLEditor {#CVE-2022-37430}

A malicious content author could add a Javascript payload to the `href` attribute of a link. A similar issue was identified and fixed via [CVE-2022-28803](https://www.silverstripe.org/download/security-releases/cve-2022-28803/). However, the fix didn't account for the casing of the `href` attribute.

- Severity: Medium
- CVSS: [4.6](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N/E:P/RL:O/RC:C&version=3.1)

Read the full [CVE-2022-37430 disclosure](https://https://www.silverstripe.org/download/security-releases/CVE-2022-37430)

### CVE-2022-37429 Stored XSS using HTMLEditor {#CVE-2022-37429}

A malicious content author could add a Javascript payload to the `href` attribute of a link by splitting a `javascript` url with white space characters.

- Severity: Medium
- CVSS: [4.6](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N/E:P/RL:O/RC:C&version=3.1)

Read the full [CVE-2022-37429 disclosure](https://https://www.silverstripe.org/download/security-releases/CVE-2022-37429)

### CVE-2022-37421 Stored XSS when creating a page with "Custom Meta Tags" {#CVE-2022-37421}

A malicious content author could create a custom meta tag and execute an arbitrary Javascript payload. This would require convincing a legitimate user to access the page and enter a custom keyboard shortcut.

- Severity: Low
- CVSS: [3.7](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N&version=3.1)

Read the full [CVE-2022-37421 disclosure](https://https://www.silverstripe.org/download/security-releases/CVE-2022-37421)

### CVE-2022-38147 Stored XSS by uploading ".gpx" file {#CVE-2022-38147}

A malicious content author could upload a GPX file with a Javascript payload. The payload could then be executed by luring a legitimate user to view the file in a browser with support for GPX files. GPX is an XML based format used to contained GPS data.

By default, Silverstripe CMS will no longer allow GPX files to be uploaded to the assets area. 

You can [re-enable support for GPX file](/developer_guides/files/allowed_file_types/#file-extensions-validation) if you have a need for them, but beware there's an inherent risk in allowing content author in using this file format.

- Severity: Medium
- CVSS: [4.6](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N/E:P/RL:O/RC:C&version=3.1)

## Future jQuery update {#jquery}

Historically, the team looking after Silverstripe CMS has not been overly concerned with upgrading jQuery because it was perceived that any underlying vulnerability in this Javascript library would be mitigated by having user input go through our PHP backend. The [CVE-2022-38146](#CVE-2022-38146) has caused us to reaccess this position.

Upgrading to the latest version of jQuery in a patch release was not considered a viable solution. We elected to mitigate the vulnerability with a workaround.

jQuery will be upgraded from 1.7 to 3.6 in the upcoming Silverstripe CMS 4.12.0 release. This may impact some third party modules who use entwine/jQuery to interact with the Silverstripe CMS UI. The Silverstripe CMS 4.12.0 beta is now available. We encourage all maintainers to test their modules against this beta to identify potential regressions.

We appreciate the awkwardness of upgrading jQuery in Silverstripe CMS 4 at this time, with Silverstripe CMS 5 on the horizon. However, since Silverstripe CMS 4 still has two years of life left, the risk of running an unsupported jQuery version seemed too great.

## Regression test and Security audit {#audit}

This release has been comprehensively regression tested and passed to a third party for a security-focused audit.

While it is still advised that you perform your own due diligence when upgrading your project, this work is performed to ensure a safe and secure upgrade with each recipe release.

## Bugfixes

Beyond the 9 vulnerability patches since the Silverstripe CMS 4.11.0 release, the following bug fixes will also be included if you deploy all the security patches.
