# Getting started with Silverstripe

Before you start developing your first web application, you'll need to install the latest version of Silverstripe onto a
web server. The [Getting Started](/getting_started) section will show you what
[server requirements](/getting_started/server_requirements) you will need to meet and how to
[install Silverstripe with Composer](/getting_started/composer).

To check out the features that Silverstripe offers without installing it, read
the [Feature Overview](https://www.silverstripe.org/software/)
and play with our [interactive demos](https://silverstripe.org/try).
