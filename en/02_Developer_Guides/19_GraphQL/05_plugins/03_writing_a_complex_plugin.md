## Writing a complex plugin

For this example, we'll imagine that a lot of our DataObjects are geocoded, and this is ostensibly some kind of
`DataExtension` that adds lat/lon information to the `DataObject`, and maybe allows you to ask how close it is to
a given lat/lon pair.

We want any queries using these DataObjects to be able to search within a radius of a given lat/lon.

To do this, we'll need a few things:

- DataObjects that are geocodable should always expose their lat/lon fields for GraphQL queries
- `read` operations for DataObjects that are geocodable should include a `within` parameter
- An input type for this lat/lon parameter should be globally available to the schema
- A resolver should automatically filter the result set by proximity.

Let's get started.

### Step 1: ensure `DataObject` models expose lat/lon fields

Since we're dealing with `DataObject` models, we'll need to implement a [`ModelTypePlugin`](api:SilverStripe\GraphQL\Schema\Interfaces\ModelTypePlugin).

```php
namespace App\GraphQL\Plugin;

use App\Geo\GeocodableExtension;
use SilverStripe\GraphQL\Schema\Interfaces\ModelTypePlugin;
use SilverStripe\GraphQL\Schema\Schema;
use SilverStripe\GraphQL\Schema\Type\ModelType;
// ...

class GeocodableModelPlugin implements ModelTypePlugin
{
    public function getIdentifier(): string
    {
        return 'geocode';
    }

    public function apply(ModelType $type, Schema $schema, array $config = []): void
    {
        $class = $type->getModel()->getSourceClass();

        // sanity check that this is a DataObject
        Schema::invariant(
            is_subclass_of($class, DataObject::class),
            'The %s plugin can only be applied to types generated by %s models',
            __CLASS__,
            DataObject::class
        );

        // only apply the plugin to geocodable DataObjects
        if (!ViewableData::has_extension($class, GeocodableExtension::class)) {
            return;
        }

        $type->addField('Lat')
            ->addField('Lon');
    }
}
```

And register the plugin:

```yml
SilverStripe\Core\Injector\Injector:
  SilverStripe\GraphQL\Schema\Registry\PluginRegistry:
    constructor:
      - 'App\GraphQL\Plugin\GeocodableModelPlugin'
```

Once we've [applied the plugin](#step-5-apply-the-plugins), all DataObjects that have the `GeocodableExtension` extension will be forced to expose their lat/lon fields.

### Step 2: add a new parameter to the queries

We want any `readXXX` query to include a `within` parameter if it's for a geocodable `DataObject`.
For this, we're going to implement [`ModelQueryPlugin`](api:SilverStripe\GraphQL\Schema\Interfaces\ModelQueryPlugin),
because this is for queries generated by a model.

```php
namespace App\GraphQL\Plugin;

// ...

class GeocodableQueryPlugin implements ModelQueryPlugin
{
    public function getIdentifier(): string
    {
        return 'geocodableQuery';
    }

    public function apply(ModelQuery $query, Schema $schema, array $config = []): void
    {
        $class = $query->getModel()->getSourceClass();
        // Only apply to geocodable objects
        if (!ViewableData::has_extension($class, GeocodableExtension::class)) {
            return;
        }

        $query->addArg('within', 'SearchRadiusInput');
    }
}
```

Register the new plugin

```yml
SilverStripe\Core\Injector\Injector:
  SilverStripe\GraphQL\Schema\Registry\PluginRegistry:
    constructor:
      - 'App\GraphQL\Plugin\GeocodableModelPlugin'
      - 'App\GraphQL\Plugin\GeocodableQueryPlugin'
```

Now after we [apply the plugins](#step-5-apply-the-plugins), our read queries will have a new parameter:

```graphql
query readEvents(within: ...)
```

But we're not done yet! What is `SearchRadiusInput`? We haven't defined that yet. Ideally, we want our query
to look like this:

```graphql
query {
  readEvents(within: {
    lat: 123.123456,
    lon: 123.123456,
    proximity: 500,
    unit: METER
  }) {
    nodes {
      title
      lat
      lon
    }
  }
}
```

### Step 3: adding an input type

We'll need this `SearchRadiusInput` to be shared across queries. It's not specific to any `DataObject`.
For this, we can implement [`SchemaUpdater`](api:SilverStripe\GraphQL\Schema\Interfaces\SchemaUpdater).
For tidiness, let's just to this in the same `GeocodeableQuery` class, since they share concerns.

```php
namespace App\GraphQL\Plugin;

use SilverStripe\GraphQL\Schema\Interfaces\SchemaUpdater;
use SilverStripe\GraphQL\Schema\Type\Enum;
use SilverStripe\GraphQL\Schema\Type\InputType;
// ...

class GeocodableQueryPlugin implements ModelQueryPlugin, SchemaUpdater
{
    // ...

    public static function updateSchema(Schema $schema): void
    {
        $unitType = Enum::create('Unit', [
            'METER' => 'METER',
            'KILOMETER' => 'KILOMETER',
            'FOOT' => 'FOOT',
            'MILE' => 'MILE',
        ]);
        $radiusType = InputType::create('SearchRadiusInput')
            ->setFields([
                'lat' => 'Float!',
                'lon' => 'Float!',
                'proximity' => 'Int!',
                'unit' => 'Unit!',
            ]);
        $schema->addType($unitType);
        $schema->addType($unitType);
    }
}
```

So now we can run queries with these parameters, but we need to somehow apply it to the result set.

### Step 4: add a resolver to apply the filter

All these DataObjects have their own resolvers already, so we can't really get into those to change
their functionality without a massive hack. This is where the idea of **resolver middleware** and
**resolver afterware** comes in really useful.

**Resolver middleware** runs *before* the operation's assigned resolver
**Resolver afterware** runs *after* the operation's assigned resolver

Middlewares and afterwares are pretty straightforward. They get the same `$args`, `$context`, and `$info`
parameters as the assigned resolver, but the first argument, `$result` is mutated with each resolver.

In this case, we're going to be filtering our `DataList` procedurally and transforming it into an array.
We need to know that things like filters and sort have already been applied, because they expect a `DataList`
instance. So we'll need to do this fairly late in the chain. Afterware makes the most sense.

```php
namespace App\GraphQL\Plugin;

use App\Geo\Proximity;
// ...

class GeocodableQueryPlugin implements ModelQueryPlugin, SchemaUpdater
{
    // ...

    public function apply(ModelQuery $query, Schema $schema, array $config = []): void
    {
        $class = $query->getModel()->getSourceClass();
        // Only apply to geocodable objects
        if (!ViewableData::has_extension($class, GeocodableExtension::class)) {
            return;
        }

        $query->addArg('within', 'SearchRadiusInput');
        $query->addResolverAfterware([static::class, 'applyRadius']);
    }

    public static function applyRadius($result, array $args): array
    {
        $results = [];
        $proximity = new Proximity($args['unit'], $args['lat'], $args['lon']);
        foreach ($result as $record) {
            if ($proximity->isWithin($args['proximity'], $record->Lat, $record->Lon)) {
                $results[] = $record;
            }
        }

        return $results;
    }
}
```

Looking good!

But there's still one little gotcha. This is likely to be run after pagination has been executed, so our
`$result` parameter is probably an array of `edges`, `nodes`, etc.

```php
// app/src/GraphQL/Resolver/MyResolver.php
namespace App\GraphQL\Resolver;

use App\Geo\Proximity;

class MyResolver
{
    public static function applyRadius($result, array $args)
    {
        $results = [];
        // imaginary class
        $proximity = new Proximity($args['unit'], $args['lat'], $args['lon']);
        foreach ($result['nodes'] as $record) {
            if ($proximity->isWithin($args['proximity'], $record->Lat, $record->Lon)) {
                $results[] = $record;
            }
        }

        return [
            'edges' => $results,
            'nodes' => $results,
            'pageInfo' => $result['pageInfo'],
        ];
    }
}
```

If we added this plugin in middleware rather than afterware,
we could filter the result set by a list of `IDs` early on, which would allow us to keep
a `DataList` throughout the whole cycle, but this would force us to loop over an
unlimited result set, and that's never a good idea.

> [!WARNING]

### Step 5: apply the plugins

We can apply the plugins to queries and DataObjects one of two ways:

- Add them on a case-by-case basis to our config
- Add them as default plugins so that we never have to worry about it.

Let's look at each approach:

#### Case-by-case

```yml
# app/_graphql/models.yml
App\Model\Event:
  plugins:
    geocode: true
  fields:
    title: true
  operations:
    read:
      plugins:
        geocodeableQuery: true
```

This can get pretty verbose, so you might just want to register them as default plugins for all DataObjects
and their `read` operations. In this case we've already added logic within the plugin itself to skip
DataObjects that don't have the `GeoCodable` extension.

#### Apply by default

```yml
# apply the `DataObject` plugin
SilverStripe\GraphQL\Schema\DataObject\DataObjectModel:
  default_plugins:
    geocode: true
# apply the query plugin
SilverStripe\GraphQL\Schema\DataObject\ReadCreator:
  default_plugins:
    geocodableQuery: true
```
