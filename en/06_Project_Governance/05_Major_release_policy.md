# Major Release Policy

## Scope of the policy

This policy applies to all commercially supported modules. Community modules are not covered by this policy. Modules under the `silverstripe` vendor name that are not commercially supported are updated on a best effort basis.

## General approach to Major releases

Silverstripe CMS aims to deliver regular major releases at predefined intervals with a clear support timeline. The key objective of this policy is to allow Silverstripe CMS project owners to plan major upgrades ahead of time. 

## Upgrading to a new major release

The main function of major releases is to ship "breaking changes" that can not be shipped in a minor releases.

Major releases are not backward compatible. Most projects will require at least some development work to upgrade to a new major release.

Silverstripe CMS provides a clear upgrade path to new major releases. This includes clear documentation on what breaking changes have been made to each area of Silverstripe CMS.

## Major release lifecycle

A Silverstripe CMS major release line follows a predefined life cycle.

### Pre-release

A Silverstripe CMS stable major release is preceded by beta period of at least three month. The purpose of the beta period is to:

- allow early adopters to plan their upgrade
- identify bugs in the major release
- help community module add support for the new major early on.

Once a new major enters the beta period, it should be compatible with the dependencies intended to ship in the stable release. Substantial breaking changes should be avoided post-beta.

Prior to the beta period, alpha releases are published at the discretion of the development team.
