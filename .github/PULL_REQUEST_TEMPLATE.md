- [ ] The target branch is correct
    - See [branches and commit messages](https://docs.silverstripe.org/en/contributing/documentation#branches-and-commit-messages)

- [ ] The commit messages follow our [commit message guidelines](https://docs.silverstripe.org/en/contributing/code/#commit-messages)
- [ ] The PR follows our [contribution guidelines](https://docs.silverstripe.org/en/contributing/documentation/)
